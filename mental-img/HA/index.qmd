# research question and hypothesis

## preliminary

## Q:
- how do mental images relate in wordfields i.e. what are typical resp. atypical semantic fields in which imageability of patients language increases or decreases?
- how do word categories from concrete to abstract influence imageablity in relation to controls language?
- are there genres/fields which are avoided/promoted?

## hypothesis
we assume that:

1. violence wordfield increase imageability
  1.1 body associated wordfields in contrast decrease imageability
2. food wordfield decrease imageability
3. weather/climate/atmosphere wordfield decrease imageability
3. abstract categories increase in imageability
4. concrete categories decrease in imageability
