	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to interpret and generate human language, yet their ability to process clinical language remains underexplored. This study examined whether three open-source LLMs can infer interviewer questions from participant responses in a semi-structured psychiatric interview (NET) conducted with individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 107) and neurotypical controls (n = 66). Using cosine similarity between LLM-generated questions and original questions as a proxy for the precision of the inference, we found that responses from individuals with schizophrenia produced significantly lower similarity scores (β = –0.165, p {\textless} .001). Cosine similarity decreased across the nested structure of the interview, with smaller reductions observed in the schizophrenia group. Although all emotions decreased similarity with fear, only sadness showed a significant interaction with diagnosis, suggesting differential processing of emotional discourse. Model type and generation temperature also influenced outcomes, highlighting variability in model performance. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs systematically struggle to reconstruct interviewer intent from responses by individuals with schizophrenia, reflecting known discourse-level disturbances in the disorder.},

	abstract = {Many people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) experience profound amotivation, which is strongly related to anticipatory anhedonia. Yet, the neuropsychological fundamentals of anticipatory anhedonia and amotivation are barely understood, resulting in a lack of effective treatments for these patients. Aberrancies in positive mental imagery may interfere with the anticipation of pleasure and could thus explain anticipatory anhedonia and amotivation. However, the nature of mental imagery and its relationship with amotivational psychopathology in SSD is largely unknown. In this preregistered study, we therefore examined mental imagery characteristics and their relation to anticipatory anhedonia, amotivation, and daily life activity in SSD. TheN = 86 participants included individuals with SSD (n = 43) and demographically matched healthy controls (n = 43). Mental imagery, anticipatory pleasure, amotivation, and activity engagement were assessed with structured interviews and self-report questionnaires. Ecological momentary assessment was used to measure state anticipatory pleasure and activity engagement in daily life (n = 81). Compared to the control group, the SSD group showed comparable quantity, but less vividness of mental imagery. Reduced vividness of mental imagery in SSD was significantly associated with higher anticipatory anhedonia, amotivation, and low activity engagement in cross-sectional and prospective analyses. Reduced mental imagery vividness may cause a lack of internal incentive to seek pleasurable experiences and could explain amotivation. Interventions aiming to improve mental imagery vividness and related anticipatory pleasure responses in SSD may be effective in targeting amotivation.},
