    "Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It's trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and can run on many consumer GPUs.\n",

    "First, we load the pre-trained weights of all components of the model. In this notebook we use Stable Diffusion version 1.4 ([CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)), but there are other variants that you may want to try:\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to the model id [CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4), we're also passing a specific `revision` and `torch_dtype` to the `from_pretrained` method.\n",

    "We want to ensure that every free Google Colab can run Stable Diffusion, hence we're loading the weights from the half-precision branch [`fp16`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4/tree/fp16) and also tell `diffusers` to expect the weights in float16 precision by passing `torch_dtype=torch.float16`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to ensure the highest possible precision, please make sure to remove `torch_dtype=torch.float16` at the cost of a higher memory usage."
