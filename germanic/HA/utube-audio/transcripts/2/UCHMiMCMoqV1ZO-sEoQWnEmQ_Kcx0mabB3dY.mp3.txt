 Before I begin, I would like to say a word to Klaus, who is the person for whom we organize
 this meeting.
 Our relationship over 40 years is so interesting that I could devote an entire lecture to it,
 but all I want to say is that I have kept learning from you from the beginning of my time
 as a student in Frankfurt, and I am tempted to, and I can't resist to relate this little
 anecdote that in my first year as a student, I attended the lectures and seminars of Professor
 Habermas, of course, and after this first year, I was desperate.
 So I didn't, it was my feeling that this wasn't for me, and so that it was far beyond what
 I could ever do.
 And so I went to Klaus's speech, too, and I told him Klaus, "This man has read 100 times
 as much as I have, and it is impossible to catch up with it."
 And so he said, "You're not the only one to have this problem."
 I have a piece of advice for you, specialize on something that he doesn't know anything
 about.
 So I ended up doing industrial relations.
 However, if you do something of political relevance seriously, and you pursue it to not necessarily
 the end, but to its ramifications, after a while, the specialization gives way to the
 need to connect to larger problems.
 Subscribe to this in spite of the fact that there are the intimidating examples of how
 to make these connections.
 So far, on by way of introduction.
 Today I want to say something with a few, and I show you also a few things like, "Okay,
 I think this is here."
 Yeah.
 I have slightly changed the title.
 Liberal democracy, hard times for democratic theory.
 And this is what I want to address.
 I have prepared 11 points that I want to make, but 11 is a bad number, so it will be only
 10.
 And the 11th point I will add in the discussion if needed.
 First of all, what is urgently needed is a renewal of critical democratic theory.
 The current crisis of the democratic capitalist state system should remind democratic theory
 that what used to be one of its central issues, the relationship between democracy and capitalism.
 What is needed is a rediscovery of all such as Dal, but also Hayek.
 Hayek I think is the man who is hovering over Europe today with his sort of depoliticized
 economic institutions.
 But also, the work of Klaus and Jürgen Havan must in the early 1970s.
 And it would be extremely interesting.
 It is extremely interesting, I can say, to reread the work on crisis theory.
 My impression is that in subsequent decades, under the impression of the performance of
 the economy, we forgot how critical, how deeply fragile this order is.
 And we are now only now looking back and we're seeing that there were ideas there that
 should not have been pushed as much into the background as we did.
 But I was one of those who thought that crisis theory was out.
 And that institutions were good enough to handle the problem.
 What I suggest is including in democratic theory what I call a parametric specification
 from abstract discussions of majority rule versus minority rights, autonomy versus collective
 will, how to secure the real question now is more specific.
 How to secure a normatively legitimate social order in the face of free markets, an integrated
 global economy, unequal resource endowments, cumulative advantage, and increasing
 competition.
 And what I want to do is I want to show how deep the problem is by discussing the issue
 of the debt crisis, the relationship between debt and democracy.
 What it means for democratic theory that the tax state, the steuertart as Schumpeter and
 Goldschild used to call it, roughly a hundred years ago, that the tax state has given
 way to the Schultenstad, to the debt state, and that the debt state is being transformed
 into a consolidation state or austerity state.
 And what that means for, let's say the next 20 years of democracy in our countries.
 And I'm talking not about democracy in general because I want this parametric specification.
 And my subject is democracy in the democratic countries of the OECD world.
 Not the transitional, where you have very, very different specific problems.
 Second point, democratic theory from the right, public choice.
 What we have seen in the last 20 years is that public choice theory has basically taken
 the place of democratic theory in the public discourse.
 Today the relationship between capitalism and democracy is discussed mainly by the right.
 Economic theories, public choice theories of the common pool blame the public debt crisis
 on democracy, not being able to respect economic laws, democracy failure.
 And claim that for capitalism to work, democracy must be restrained.
 But finances being a common pool, there's not enough discipline in the democracy to prevent
 organized citizens from taking more out than they put in.
 Essentially that's the old story of the tragedy of the commons, reheated in different language
 as a model.
 And it's the old story of primitive accumulation being described to us as an act of efficiency,
 economic rationalization.
 The solution is reduction by public spending, by Hayekian institutions that are insulated
 against political pressure in analogy to an independent central bank.
 This is what we're now seeing in Europe.
 And this is, I think, what is inevitable in Europe.
 This is coming.
 Third point, the alternative.
 Something that we as progressive intellectuals must push forward into the debate, into
 also the public discussion is a historical theory of the relationship between capitalism
 and democracy that avoids anti, that avoids Hayekian anti-democratic revisionism.
 Meaning public debt by capitalism, not being able or willing to live with democracy, capitalism
 failure rather than democracy failure, and argue that for democracy to work, capitalism
 must be restrained.
 So we turn the table around.
 Rather than an abstract model, the argument requires recourse to a historical context.
 In particular, the context of the temporary reconciliation, temporary, as we now know,
 reconciliation of capitalism and democracy under the so-called post-war settlement embedded
 liberalism is the concept that we usually use for this.
 After this war, a restoration of capitalism was deemed accessible across the political
 spectrum.
 Secondly, if capitalism could be made compatible with elementary human interests by very strict
 conditions on its operation, in fact also promises of its future performance.
 And here is a list.
 Exhibit one.
 And you can go through this list and you will see from today's perspective, all of these
 are these utopian ideas about stable employment, extensive public services.
 But this was part of the package, not just in Germany and Europe, but also in the United
 States, in the New Deal United States in the 1950s and well into the 1960s.
 Country the United States was subject to capital controls in order to be able to manage the
 domestic economy.
 This is also not a list of items that people invent in their unending search for good life.
 It is, or for an easy life.
 It is what made capitalism acceptable for these post-war societies.
 It was the condition for the hunting license for capitalists to be renewed.
 And of course, these are all sort of revisable, but basically no, the fundamental assumption
 that underlies all this is that no society can exist on market justice alone.
 No society can exist as a market.
 There must be modifications of the market for people to be able and willing to live with
 this.
 And now is my fourth point. What we observed over a long period of 30, 40 years was a process
 of liberalization and the break up of this post-war settlement.
 It begins with the end of post-war growth in the late 1960s and the failure of economic
 planning.
 Mixed economy.
 When I studied sociology, the economy was a mixed economy, not a market economy.
 And England, France, remember the book by Andrew Schonfield on modern capitalism.
 All these countries were full of mechanisms, institutions that were to contain the market
 rather than to let it free.
 The break up of the post-war settlement begins with the end of post-war growth in the
 1960s and with a failure of economic planning.
 When capitalism turned out to be unable to deliver on the post-war democratic peace formula,
 the Friedens formula, this capitalism, so he's the Stanwagens by Wundsen Frankfurt.
 In the 1970s, a long-drawn process of liberalization began, which in effect amounted to a
 gradual withdrawal of capitalism from the commitments extracted from and entered by it at the end
 of the war.
 Needs to restructure under pressures of alleged pressures of globalization, where and continue
 to be involved to justify structural unemployment, individualization of employment contract, renewal
 of minigil, pre-organization, privatization, precarious employment, and reconmodifying social
 policy, rapidly growing wage dispersion and social inequality.
 We have to have this historical memory to know what is at stake in the game that is now
 being planned.
 Fifth point, I call this "incompensation three expensive masses of potage."
 Now for the Germans, the German word for a mass of potage is "in linsengericht."
 It's a biblical story about selling your birthright for nothing.
 Liberalization, you could also say, the coming out of capitalism or coming out again of
 capitalism, proceeded during this period.
 Economic growth was successively replaced in its role as pacifier of economic conflict
 and stabilizer of social peace by inflation in the 1970s, public debt in the 1980s, and
 deregulation of private debt in the 1990s.
 So, we have to have a positive impact on the political system.
 Inflation, public debt and private debt provided rough corrections of the distributional outcomes
 of expanding markets.
 You can call it "dirty equity."
 Rough corrections, rough justice, some justice.
 But of course, all three were no more than stopgaps that worked only for a short time until
 the economic disfunctions began to prevail.
 Inflation was repaired by union breaking.
 Public indebtedness by public expenditure cuts.
 Private indebtedness by fiscal expansion.
 And renewed public indebtedness by global austerity.
 Now this is the period where we are now.
 Historically, the arena where stagnant growth, together with rising inequality, is compensated,
 growth from the labor market, inflation to electoral politics, debt, from there to private
 capital markets, deregulation of private debt, and today to financial diplomacy and international
 markets.
 I have shown how the successive arenas were increasingly better protected from the political
 participation and intervention of ordinary people.
 Six point.
 Relativity in retreat.
 Rather than the various forms of rough justice allowed to cover up low growth and rising inequality.
 The dominant development since the 1970s was the erosion of the post-wastatlement and
 the liberation of capitalism from democratic control.
 Unlike what was promised, liberalization has restored growth only for those at the upper
 end of society.
 While it has pulled the bottom out from under the labor market for ordinary people.
 And that is also a relatively general process.
 It includes even Sweden with rising inequality and structural unemployment of 5, 6, 7 percent
 for a long, long time with the government having given up on the political full employment
 commitment.
 The dissolution of the post-wastatlement has done more damage to democracy than to capital
 capitalism.
 As capitalism has liberated itself, the reputation of the political parties, trade unions, and democratic
 elections has continuously declined over these 30 years of liberalism, which is an interesting
 anti-Iyekian argument.
 It cannot have been democratic pressure because there was less and less democratic pressure,
 less voter participation.
 So let's look at exhibit two.
 No, no, this was wrong here.
 This is where the exhibit took it.
 This is my colleague, Ahm in Sheffa, who looks at turnout in parliamentary elections.
 And there you see from the 1960s, 1970s onwards, and this is sort of the whole OECD world.
 There is a steady decline in election participation.
 You could now add figures on union membership, party membership is all the same.
 Public survey data, reputation of unions, it's all the same.
 It sort of varies from country country, but the trend is always the same.
 And here is Germany, 1970s, 1990s.
 And then I mean in this work which is to come out soon, looks at who is abstaining.
 And it is completely clear that the abstentions are concentrated at the lower end of the society.
 That what happens is that people in the last desial, in the last two desial, sort of disappear
 from politics.
 Which has a sort of reinforcing effect on the behavior of political parties who know
 that in these areas where these people live, you will not be able to get many votes.
 Therefore you don't go there.
 So you write your programs more and more for the middle class, like in the United States,
 where the interests of these people who don't vote, you don't have to cater to.
 In fact you shouldn't, because that could scare away your voters.
 Seven, the rise of public debt in parallel to the rise of neoliberalism, as capitalism
 struggled free from its post-war constraints.
 Rather than resulting from an increase in the power of democracy, the fiscal crisis of
 the state under advanced capitalism developed as economic inequality increased, wages stagnated
 and welfare states were reformed.
 This is a parallel development.
 And I have seven countries that stand for different, you can take averages, you can do what you
 want.
 It's always the same curve.
 Public debt all over in the capitalist world.
 In social democratic Sweden, as well as in Republican United States, in liberal, as well as
 coordinated market economies, in presidential, as well as parliamentary democracies, doesn't
 matter.
 The latest critical jump in public debt after the party's successful consolidation efforts
 of the 1990s and early 2000, which were compensated by increasing public private debt, did not
 result from irresponsible democratic politics, but was caused by the financial crisis turning
 into a fiscal crisis.
 This is where the red line comes in.
 The increase in public debt after 2008 has nothing to do with democratic pressure.
 It had to do with the need to bail out the financial institutions.
 And we now have good data that the fiscal crisis is bigger in countries where you have
 a large financial sector.
 And there's a strong correlation between the two.
 It looks a bit concerned, how far are we?
 OK, good, good, good.
 The rise point eight is only three more points.
 The rise of the debt state coincided with the decline of the tax state.
 Democratic theory must consider the possibility that the gap between public spending and public
 revenue may be due rather than to some citizens taking too much out of the common pool to some
 other citizens not putting enough in.
 And here I take an average of my seven countries and you see that the lower curve is the government
 revenue in percent of GDP.
 And you see that while expenditure increases as it did in the 1960s, roughly about in the
 early 1980s there is an end to the increase in taxation in these societies.
 So a gap opens up between spending and taxation.
 And my hypothesis which I find plausible is the following.
 Increasing demand on public finances under contemporary capitalism may indicate rather
 than frivolous waste by democratically empowered citizens.
 A growing need under capitalist modernization for public investment in infrastructural support
 and public spending on social repairs.
 Social repairs through social policy.
 As the social fabric crumbles under the pressure of modernization.
 Interesting, Wagner's law becomes extremely interesting.
 He explains the need for rising expenditure by the modernization of society.
 You also remember Karl Marx incidentally about this idea of the growing socialization of
 the process of production in a world of private property where at some stage you get a fundamental
 contradiction between the need for collective investment spending and so on and the private
 property in a bourgeois society.
 This was already a concern of people like Goldschild and Schumpeter at the beginning of the
 20th century.
 Schumpeter was convinced that the tax state could still survive this.
 Goldschild was less sure.
 But now 100 years later we see that in this curve there could be a problem and it could
 be there again.
 So stagnant public revenue may be related to growing tax resistance at the end of the
 post war economic growth period and at the end of inflation.
 There's a good argument why this should be the case.
 Moreover liberal democracy with open borders has made it increasingly possible, especially
 for large firms and the owners of monetary assets to avoid contributing to covering the
 social costs of their own prosperity.
 This is also interesting.
 Here we look at the rates of taxation in these four societies and we're looking at 1989
 beginning.
 In all these cases we see a sort of if you draw a trend line conspicuous sort of tendency
 of taxation to fall.
 If there was an unsposed inflation, inflation of demands involved in the rise of the debt
 state, I claim it was on the part of the well to do who managed to keep their growing wealth
 to themselves rather than share it with the public. The Schumpeterian tax state I claim
 or we observe has outlived itself and gives way to a modern debt state.
 Point nine, democratic failure question mark.
 Yes?
 First failure not to have prevented the neoliberal re-awakening of capitalism which would
 have rendered its compensation by deficit spending unnecessary.
 I'm willing to argue this point.
 Secondly, not to have regulated the financial sector at the international level.
 So is to protect governments from the need to rescue it and societies that were allowed
 to become dependent on it needed also to be rescued.
 Like the United States where 40% of private sector profits in the middle of the last century,
 last decade came from the financial sector.
 Third, not to have taxed the beneficiaries of capitalist growth and prevented them from
 evading their responsibility to pay for it.
 In other words, not to have forced them to internalize such costs, making growth less attractive
 by forcing them to, which would be interesting if you think of limits of growth.
 Why not tax growth?
 Rather than subsidize it.
 And finally, not to have understood the distributional implications of debt financing, of debt financing
 of public responsibilities.
 That and I owe this insight to Carl Christian von Weitzeker who likes the picture that
 I'm going to draw, but I dislike it.
 But otherwise we agree on the picture.
 That is taxes not collected.
 The owners of money rather than having it confiscated by the state can keep it, lend it to the
 state, save investment for Mørn's build on, private capital accumulation, get interest
 on it and pass it on to their children.
 Instead of taking the money from the rich to pay for growth and the infrastructure of democratic
 equality, states borrow it from them and pay interest on it to them.
 They are by reinforcing and extending social inequality and making themselves dependent
 on the markets.
 Now Weitzeker costs this, my Jackubinoid believes about the world.
 I'm willing to accept this.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Why should they keep it?
 Tenth point and last point.
 The contemporary debt state.
 A struggle between two constituencies.
 The current crisis marks a new stage in the relationship between democracy and capitalism,
 requiring, as I said at the outset, a radical rethinking of democratic theory.
 The crisis of 2008 has increased public debt to a level where creditors lost confidence
 that states will be able to serve their debt.
 Partly because the same creditors cost this financial crisis and had to be rescued by states
 taking up too much debt to ensure that their investment is not lost.
 Credit creditors have taken a more active role in the governance of democratic states.
 Much like the activist shareholders of the shareholder value age of publicly traded firms.
 So I would think that states have become very much like large companies exposed to the capital
 market.
 And here is my exhibit for a sort of categorical scheme within which this new situation
 one might want to discuss.
 The debt state has taken the place of the debt state that has taken the place of the
 text state has two constituencies, not just one, its creditors and its citizens competing
 with one another for attention and control.
 Philippe will recognize this.
 We once developed this notion about the logic of influence and the logic of membership
 in intermediary organizations.
 It's something like this.
 A complicated and as yet largely unexplored struggle over primacy between the two states
 the debt states two constituencies.
 So I can't go into this.
 I will only ask you to look at the list of items.
 So one is one considers the national, the other's international which gives it a great advantage.
 One is citizens, the other is investors.
 Investors have much less loyalty than citizens.
 And they are not sticky to the soil.
 Voters and creditors, rights of citizenship are sort of complemented by claims to assets.
 One is sort of grounded in public law, constitutional law, the other is grounded in civil law, contract
 law.
 The one constituency articulates it will through periodical elections every four years.
 The other three options, the options take place continuously and what they think about
 the government they express by raising or lowering the interest rate when you refinance
 your next torch.
 Public opinion enters.
 Citizens have loyalty.
 The markets have this strange thing which is called confidence which can go and away.
 And you can pretend that you don't have confidence anymore even if you have.
 And public services sort of are complemented by that.
