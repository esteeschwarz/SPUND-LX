 Okay, so, my first question would be,
 you being a politician in the UK,
 how do you think the current crisis will affect the UK,
 EU relations event, the public perception?
 Well, the European Union is a great thing for the United Kingdom
 and I think the UK is an important part of the European Union.
 It's important for us economically in terms of jobs,
 it's important for us as a way of projecting power in the world.
 Britain is not an empire anymore.
 We're a medium sized country within enormous history,
 but one of the ways in which we can help influence the world,
 engage with Russia, China, India and others,
 is through the European Union.
 So, I think most people in Britain realise that,
 but there's sometimes an anger and frustration
 because Europe does things that drives some British people a bit angry.
 And I can understand that as well.
 We have you observed any change in the perceptions
 over the last couple of years,
 and do you think overall the crisis will have a positive or negative impact
 on the way Europe is perceived?
 I think it can only be an negative impact.
 Any crisis initially creates an negative sentiment,
 is how you then resolve the crisis,
 once you resolve the crisis, if it's done properly, if it's done fairly,
 if it's done in a way that strengthens the economy,
 then opinions may change back.
 In a short term, I think it's very damaging for Europe.
 And what would you say are the worst case and best case scenarios
 for Europe in the future?
 Well, Europe's got to, I think, stop talking about institutions.
 And what happens, I think, in Europe, is there's a problem.
 Let's design an institution and work out what it does afterwards.
 We should decide what's Europe's role in the world.
 What do we have to do in building institutions around that,
 rather than the other way around, which sometimes happens at the moment?
 But I think the most important thing Europe can do is
 have a sense of economic growth,
 and give a chance to businesses to grow for people to get jobs,
 people to move around to be employed in other countries.
 But then be able effectively to project a voice on the world stage.
 Europe will never have an army.
 Europe will never have a single unified defence policy.
 Where we can cooperate together, that's really very important.
 Particularly at a time when America is occupied
 intellectually, perhaps with China,
 and other pressures in President Obama has been talked of
 as the first Pacific president.
 Europe has got to do more, particularly in its own backyard
 on foreign policy and defence.
 Okay, that was going to be my next question about Europe's role
 in global defence, because these are facing an increasingly global
 and Europe can't deal with it on its own.
 So what positions do you think Europe should take in the global arena?
 I don't think the European Union or the European Parliament
 will become the decision-making body on defence policy,
 or defence deployment of our forces,
 but we can have a lot more cooperation,
 a deeper cooperation, a wider cooperation,
 so that we structure our forces in a way that are complementary,
 and at a time when we're making cuts in our defence expenditure,
 we make cuts that mean at the end of it,
 all of the countries in Europe go members of NATO,
 do it in a way that means they've got a balance,
 the right type of balance.
 We can't all get out of fast jets,
 not the need to get them, won't get out of fast jets,
 but you can't all be making those decisions,
 so that's a really important point.
 We've got too many soldiers who can't deploy,
 I think there are two million people in uniform
 in the European Union, only 5% of them can deploy.
 There are too many tanks that we can never be used,
 there are too many fast jets that can never be used,
 there's not enough helicopter lift.
 So all of these big things, we can't fix that ourselves,
 and the United Kingdom, Germany can't fix it itself,
 so it's about cooperation,
 but it won't be through the EU,
 it won't be through the European Parliament,
 it won't be through the Commission,
 it'll be European countries together,
 or through NATO, that will make that happen.
 And finally, could you summarize the main
 immediate challenges to European security,
 which areas do you see as the most problematic one?
 The main threat, I think, is the groups of malevolent
 and violent individuals acquiring chemical
 or biological capability,
 or a knowledge on cyberattack
 that could really cause European countries
 and economies very significant.
 Difficulty, that's a big threat.
 But I think a wider threat is a threat of ambivalence,
 that after Iraq and after Afghanistan,
 public opinion in Europe says,
 "Let's not get involved in any further conflicts overseas,
 at a time of austerity at home,
 let's just look after our people at home."
 So that's state of ambivalence,
 I think, is a really difficult threat
 for European countries.
 And I think we have to engage with it
 and try and make an argument.
 This says, "We have a responsibility to be on the wrong borders,
 and unless we deal with those problems in the world,
 of terror, of climate change,
 unless we deal with them abroad,
 we'll have to deal with them at home."
 So I think that's the biggest threat.
 Okay, thank you so much for your time.
