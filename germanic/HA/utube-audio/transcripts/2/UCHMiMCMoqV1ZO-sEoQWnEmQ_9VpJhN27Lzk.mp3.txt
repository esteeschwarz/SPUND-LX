 Thank you to the these faculty proud families.
 Most of all, to the graduating class of
 herty school, 2025.
 Thank you.
 I have come here from more than 9,000 kilometers away
 to say congratulations class of 2025.
 [Applaus]
 When I say class of 2025, I feel your energy.
 In my country when we have this kind of celebration,
 we shout together, "Oh hey, oh hey!"
 It means, yes, we are here, let's go.
 I think the whole world should know you are here and ready.
 So, let's try it together. Class of 2025.
 "Oh hey, oh hey!"
 Yes, that's what I am talking about.
 That's the spirit.
 And that spirit tells us something true.
 You are never too young to lead and we are never too old to learn.
 What an honor it is to share this moment with you.
 I was born in Western Mongolia, the youngest of eight children in sheephörders family.
 I grew up in the sharp windows of socialism,
 but wrapped in the deep wounds of my parents' compassion and love,
 as many of you are here today.
 Our home is stood in a long valley surrounded by mountains.
 When they wind picked up and it always did,
 my father would rush to pass on our gear
 and then ride out to help the neighbors.
 He moved like an arrow with wings.
 His horse flying across the step.
 When they storm past and no one lost their homes,
 people came to thank him.
 I still remember the quiet pride in his smile.
 From those days I learned one idea.
 Every good thing begins with you and grows with the help of others.
 Now it's your turn.
 You are about to begin your journey.
 Seeing you here side by side with your families
 and loved ones brings me joy.
 I see many mothers in the audience.
 In my country we have an old saying,
 always listen to your mother.
 The mother is always right.
 My father was a soldier in infantrymen during the war.
 I met the smoke and chaos.
 He taught himself to write and sent one letter home.
 That letter reached my mother.
 And she waited five long years, five winters and five springs,
 five summers and five autumn.
 With only one letter in her hands and hope in her heart.
 One evening from the sunset side,
 across the dusty valley,
 a horseman appeared.
 That was my father.
 This story taught me never to lose hope.
 No matter how long hard the road keeps going.
 You will meet your happiness.
 Your journey will continue.
 Dear class of 2025!
 Oh hey!
 Thank you.
 Many of you will now enter public life
 and work in policy, governance and advocacy.
 Let me share this truth.
 Public service is not about power.
 It's about people.
 It's about giving more than you tech.
 Give people more rights, more opportunities,
 more freedom when the people succeed, you succeed.
 Thank you.
 My country, Mongolia, has been the only vibrant democracy
 between Russia and China since 1990.
 Our people rose for freedom after a long hard winter
 cracking through snow and ice.
 Today, Mongolia's democratic example shines like a northern star
 across the Euro-Age of West and uncertain skies.
 (Applause)
 Thanks to my people's trust,
 I became Prime Minister at 35.
 I rushed to tell my mother who was in her 80s.
 "Mom!" I said.
 "I became Prime Minister!"
 She paused.
 "What is Prime Minister?"
 She was unfamiliar with the term.
 In her time, leaders were called Secrets with General
 or Politburo members.
 I tried to explain my mother listened and said,
 "Whatever it is, be grateful for your people, work hard."
 That has guided me ever since.
 I believe in every heartbeat carries a call for freedom.
 God has planted in every human heart the desire to live free.
 Even if the desire is crushed for a while, it rises again.
 In Mongolia, we speak not only for our freedom,
 but also for the freedom of others.
 When I was in office, I had the opportunity to lecture
 at Camel Song University in North Korea.
 They agreed on one condition.
 I must not mention three words, democracy, human rights,
 market economy.
 So I did not say those words in my lecture.
 Instead, I titled my talk,
 "No dictatorship lasts forever."
 That title caused me my meeting with the leader.
 But later, I was told that South Korean President Mac Twist
 had picked up my speech.
 They had flown it again into North by Air balloon.
 Words can travel farther than we imagine.
 You must master them.
 Words have more power than any other human innovation.
 One day, you may speak the truth in a place it is forbidden.
 People never forget those who helped and spoke for them
 in their "dxt hour."
 Europe, too, has shown the power of humanity.
 When warriors turned to Ukraine, Europe showed the best of itself.
 You welcomed millions of mothers and children
 by opening your homes, hospitals and schools.
 You even paid in advance for buses, cars,
 and everything else they needed.
 You did not wait to be asked.
 You helped it.
 (Applause)
 Thank you.
 That is Europe at its best.
 Europe has become the warm heart of humanity.
 This brutal war has also been harsh
 on ethnic minorities inside Russia.
 They have been sent to the front lines as cannon fodder.
 When Russia announced its first mobilization,
 I called on young Russian men especially minorities.
 I asked them to escape that through the Mongols' embrace
 and come to Mongolia.
 10,000 cities.
 If one less man holds a gun against Ukraine,
 we count that as our contribution to peace in Europe.
 (Applause)
 Thank you.
 Mongolians have a saying,
 "The good in history is my teacher
 and the bad in history is my teacher."
 History has taught us this.
 In today's world war has become obsolete.
 Every issue, no matter how difficult,
 can be resolved with fistfully, through dialogue, negotiation, and understanding.
 As Nelsa Mandela once said,
 "The most powerful weapon is to sit down and talk."
 (Applause)
 Today we are no longer voiceless.
 We have those tools to express our concerns, grievances, and truths.
 But even now, some still reach for old mapies to justify new aggression.
 President Putin once cited the Russian Imperial map
 to claim that Ukraine belonged to his empire.
 Then I responded with the math of the great Mongol Empire.
 (Laughter)
 And I wrote on Twitter,
 "After Putin's talk, I found the Mongolian historical map.
 Don't worry, we are a fistful and free nation."
 That single post reached more than 12 million people worldwide.
 Please follow me on X.
 (Applause)
 Dear class of 2025!
 (Laughter)
 This is the world we live in now.
 Where words and knowledge can fly, farther than missiles.
 We live in a new ernoissance.
 When ideas are created and shared, they scale and speed,
 unimaginable in any earlier age.
 But in this fast-moving world,
 the most critical battlefield you will ever face is yourself.
 If you want to serve, first serve your conscience.
 If you want to build a better world, make a better you.
 Character is not a gift.
 It's something you practice every day.
 Build a hub habit.
 Leadership is not a title.
 It's a decision you make in silence and noise, in crisis, and calm.
 So first, the person you would want to follow.
 I began today my speaking of compassion.
 Now let us make this moment unprogatable.
 Please close your eyes.
 Imagine someone who loves you deeply,
 see their face and feel your presence.
 Their presence.
 Imagine them.
 They are next to you.
 They take a slow deep breath.
 Quietly in your heart say to them, "I love you."
 Now open your eyes.
 Breathe that love in.
 Let it feel you.
 Let it stay with you.
 Carry that feeling into the world.
 Please share it.
 Lead with love.
 Congratulations.
 I love you.
 Thank you.
 [Applause]
 President Albeck Dors.
