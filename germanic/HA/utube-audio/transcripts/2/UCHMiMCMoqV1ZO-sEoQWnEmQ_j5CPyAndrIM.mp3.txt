 Nuclear weapons are back with a vengeance now.
 I think after the end of the Cold War, there was this assumption that nuclear weapons would
 recede into the background and become less salient international politics.
 But I think over the last ten years, especially, we've seen a resurgence of nuclear threats
 and challenges from every corner in the globe.
 From a resurgent Russia, where Putin uses nuclear weapons to seek regional, his regional
 objectives, the rise of China, as it seeks to be a nuclear superpower in North Korea,
 we just saw a conflict between India and Pakistan, and then obviously Iran's nuclear program
 and the recent conflict.
 And so with every corner of the globe now, it's impossible for nuclear weapons to not
 touch geopolitics.
 And later on top of that, changes in U.S. domestic politics and across our alliances.
 For the first time since the end of the Cold War, we have very nervous allies, some of
 whom, including, for example, South Korea, have thought about pursuing their own nuclear
 weapons.
 And so we're facing an unprecedented set of challenges both in terms of nuclear proliferation,
 but also nuclear deterrence and strategy.
 It was an honor and a privilege to serve as the principal deputy and then the acting
 assistant secretary of defense for space policy, which was sort of a catch-all office that
 had space policy, cyber policy for a while, and then nuclear encountering weapons and
 mass destruction policy.
 I probably spent the bulk of my time on nuclear encountering weapons and mass destruction
 policy, but it was all hands on deck, and we tried to address these unprecedented challenges.
