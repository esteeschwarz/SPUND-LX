 Wonderful, ich denke, wir sind gut zu getestet. Das ist die Micro-Work. So, thank you Matt.
 Welcome everyone to this roundtable, which Kai earlier today framed as the Higher Education
 roundtable, and that is how we called it internally in our preparation and organization committee.
 We thought that given all the attacks on universities, on other institutions of the democratic state,
 particularly also on universities, with mounting media coverage, but also all kinds of reports on attacks of all limits,
 on academic freedom, we thought it was time, or it's a timely topic to take up at an academic conference.
 Particularly also in the field, such as ours, public policy, regulatory governance,
 because we are generally interested in how government operates.
 We want to understand public policy, the outcome of political decision-making processes,
 and that is where, of course, limits and attacks on academic freedom will first be felt.
 But it's not only on research, we may feel it very directly or be experienced it very directly.
 It also raises questions about the public engagement role of scholars and research more in general,
 or research is more in general. And of course also, it raises questions on teaching and curriculum design.
 Do we need to adapt and change what we teach or how we teach in times in which universities and academic freedom,
 as we were used to it over the past few decades, are at least have become under pressure in across a range of contacts?
 That was sort of the starting point for this round table.
 It's my great pleasure to moderate it. My name is Tour du Stadts. I'm here from the Hedi School.
 I'm the Dean of Graduate Programs here, and also Professor of Public Administration and Management.
 And I had the pleasure to gather with Kai and our dedicated team to organize this conference.
 And I'm also very happy and very delighted to present this very distinguished group of speakers on this round table.
 And I will start sort of that way in introducing all of them.
 The first is Professor Joseph Weiler, who is a professor in law at New York University.
 He has been over the past few decades leading voice on questions of constitutional law and European integration and also the role of religion in public life.
 So that covers some of your research and areas of expertise.
 Professor Weiler is not only a professor in law at NYU, he also was president of the European University Institute in Florence for a few years.
 And he is also very active as an editor, as an author, and also as an editor in academic journals.
 So welcome, Joseph Weiler. It's a great pleasure to have you here.
 I'm also happy to welcome Katarina Starranova.
 Katarina is a associate professor of public policy at the Cominios University in Brat Slava in Slovakia.
 Katarina does research on political and administrative relations in central and eastern Europe.
 And I think she's one of the key scholars of that area and in that region.
 And Katarina has a lot to tell about what does it mean to do empirical research in particular in under conditions of contested freedom on the populist governments and authoritarianism.
 She's one of her latest publications, includes a handbook on political patronage and politicization, which is, I understand, published these days.
 And in that book, Katarina co-authors a chapter and we will come back to that chapter indeed on the implications of populist governments and authoritarian practices in government for empirical research and what that entails for researches.
 So welcome, Katarina. Very glad to have you.
 And also, David Levyforer, here by my side, I think I don't have to introduce David much in detail in this audience, everyone here knows you.
 But of course, just to make sure we all on the same page, David is a professor at Hebrew University and one of the leading scholars in regulatory governance.
 We've been foundational to the field. We discussed this and heard that yesterday also in the keynote speeches.
 And I think you're not only leading wise on that field. You also have a lot to say on what it means or what it means to do research, under changing political circumstances.
 And also what that may imply for students and teaching and the curriculum development in our field.
 And so, David, thanks for accepting this invitation to this round table.
 And so I'm looking very much forward for all three of you to get involved into this discussion.
 I would also like to have it as a very open discussion.
 So if one of you wants to respond or react to what one of the others has said, please just come in and do this.
 And then we'll react to one another. I would also like to, to the end, open the floor, of course, to questions or comments from the audience to be sort of to enable discussions also between this part of the room and that part.
 So that is important. And in general, we thought and discuss or we thought I thought about how to structure this discussion and how to sort of bring together various perspectives on that, on that broad agenda.
 And the whole idea sort of is sort of starting from the why to the what does it mean? So what are the implications and what can be done then also when it comes to the implications of polarization populism, author, andarian practice for for us as a field.
 And in terms of how we teach and do research and what our role is and maybe should be.
 And starting with the why are we seeing all of these attacks? That is the first question I would hand to Joseph Weiler and broadly sort of asking you particularly in the US, we have been sort of seen a lot of unpleasant news.
 So to speak of attacks or recent attacks accusations by the second Trump administration on universities, particularly elite universities.
 And that sort of comes hand in hand with polls from Gallup, for example, that tell us that the American public has lost trust in institutions of higher education sharply over the last 10 years.
 So my first question to you is, where is this coming from? Why do you think we see this right now?
 So the no easy answers, but at least to start talking about Trump is difficult because I'm not a psychiatrist.
 It's a little bit complicated. But the usual premise is that there's always a political objective.
 He's doing it because he think it will strengthen his base that it will be popular with people that he will gain in terms of his status and stature among the majority of Americans who voted for him.
 And what he's doing is on the whole they support it.
 There's, it's wrong at a whole variety of levels, but I think we all understand that, you know, this attack on academic freedom.
 It's not an absolute value, but he has certainly crossed any line of legitimate interference with the academic freedom.
 And particularly, ugly, that in a totally hypocritical way, he's justifying this as protecting us against anti-Semitism.
 You know, that's the narrative that he's presenting. These 10 universities, which he's targeted among them also, well, two of my universities, both Harvard and NYU.
 The claim is that this is to defend those poor Jewish students against anti-Semitism.
 It's totally hypocritical. I mean, this is the administration who comes to Germany and says that IFD is the future of Germany.
 So I don't think he has any genuine concern to, and it actually increases anti-Semitism.
 Now, a word of caution, it's not as if there's no anti-Semitism, but that is not Trump's agenda. That is just an excuse to do what he's doing.
 But you know, when we speak about populism, we always point our fingers, you know, Kaczynski, Orban, Trump, Marine Le Pen, etc.
 But if I take Francis an example, I don't think that 20 million freshmen and women suddenly became fascist.
 So we have to ask ourselves not about these people, but the support they get.
 And in the United States, but this is also true for Europe, the new class system is based on education, and there's a strong anti-elitist thing.
 And of course, what he's doing is totally wrong. But we have to ask ourselves, how have we contributed? I mean, our class of people.
 How have we contributed to this? And we have contributed to this because the kind of support that he's gaining is based on a very strong anti-elitist sentiment in the United States.
 And the anti-elitist sentiment is partly justified because these people feel disrespected. And now disrespected.
 They feel disrespected in the work that they do. It's not considered valuable work. They feel disrespected because their children don't go to college.
 And that's, if I say that the class system is not so much about money, but about education.
 So we have to be mindful of that and ask not what only prompts Trump, but what prompts the support for Trump.
 So I think that's the short answer to your question.
 I want to say, and please don't understand me in any way justifying what he's doing or what is taking place.
 But we say we have to protect academic freedom. But the institutions, the quote, elite unquote institutions, with which I have been associated.
 There is a problem of academic freedom there.
 In my current institution at NYU, but I also hear it from my students at Harvard.
 Catholic students will not dare in public to say I'm against abortion.
 And I choose the example of abortion because it's a morally complex issue. It's not an easy issue.
 I think homosexuality is an easy issue in moral terms, but abortion is more complex.
 So when Catholic students tell me we would not in public with our fellow students express our views and say we are against abortion.
 I give this as a proxy.
 We do have a problem of academic freedom before all this Trump begins.
 There's a certain what can be said and what cannot be said in the so-called progressive institution.
 Again, this is not to justify in any way and shape what Trump is doing.
 But it does mean that when hopefully the storm is over, also in that respect, we have to do some soul searching.
 Can we really say apart from in a formal sense that our institution truly respect in a vulturean sense, academic freedom and academic freedom of expression.
 And I don't think the answer is an easy of course we do.
 Thank you. That brings me David to you and to the Israeli context, which is different.
 There were also discussions about limits or threats to academic freedom in recent years, particularly surrounding the digital reform.
 And so how is your sort of experience on that question of academic freedom in the Israeli context?
 Thank you.
 Thank you, Tori, for the question.
 I must start with completely agree with Professor Baila.
 My feeling about the situation in the United States.
 Indeed, the blames that say elite institutions or liberal elite taking part in cancel culture is disturbing.
 It's not easy to see when you are part of this kind of I'm pro-abortion.
 It's very difficult to allow this and to protect, actively protect this other side.
 But we are on the left. We can, or the liberals, we can be as offensive and as canceling as the other side.
 Now going back to Israel or going to Israel, I would say that we experience similar attacks, but not to the same extent.
 We are privileged in academia still, despite almost two years of constant attack on the Israeli democracy and the liberal democracy and so on,
 goes the fourth one is the judicial system and effort to destroy it or to limit its autonomy and let the politicians rule about everything.
 Maybe rule is in the sense of governing, not rule in the sense of following rules all of law.
 It's more about their discussion. We were elected, we will decide.
 But it's still surprising how the Israeli institutions on the issue of freedom of expression is still holding the fort.
 The Israeli academia is protesting government for a few years now.
 Well, if you go even before, we are in the street for almost a decade since 2015, really.
 And it's only growing. The protest is also growing. Part of the strongest part of this protest is against the so-called democratic reform, but also against the war in Gaza, especially nowadays, especially after actually defeating Hamas.
 And in this moment, where the horrors of October 7th are really not forgotten, but we have 18 months after.
 Gradually, the Israeli public is starting to understand what's going on in Gaza and how it could be different. And I think it could be different. So all those issues are of course connected.
 And the effect of Trump on Europe and on Israel is highly negative. We are surviving.
 The Israeli academia was always part of the liberal society. Always against the government. Doesn't matter which government in many cases.
 But at the same time, we are persecuted by some of the radical left in Europe and the United States being boycotted and so on.
 So we are in one end, we are against the government and are pushing against the government, our government and some of the public.
 And the other end, we are fighting on our place in the liberal world. So we are being cancelled under the excuse that we don't want to cooperate with the Israeli institution in some place.
 What does it mean? Israeli institution means Israelis, right? And now I can see the distinction between institutions and people is not that big.
 And it applies what they feel now applies to say Russia or any other country that is which is government or is government is really problematic.
 But still the population is not always responsible and cannot be responsible for the crimes of say the crimes or the inappropriate activities of government.
 This is true to Gaza of course, but it's also true to the Israelis.
 Thank you.
 May I just add one more question and how all this, how you see this reflected in classroom and discussions with students?
 There are few styles of teachings or engaging with politics in class. I try to put politics outside class, politics in the sense of those very difficult questions out of class.
 But I meet my students in the demonstrations and they have access to my Facebook and they know that I would not use my position as a teacher to educate.
 Also because I am not that effective as educators, they have other sources of influence that shape their mind. And I think that the more balanced approach and taking distance from the most pressing issues is useful for the students.
 And I am optimistic about this strategy, rather than making my class a political propaganda basis for political propaganda and so on.
 I was just reading an article in New York Times about a professor in New York, one of the colleges.
 I think her name is Finkelstein, I don't know if you may be read it. She was fired from her college. She was really pro-pros-pros-pachamas. And she was fired from her college.
 I thought it's not still, I don't like it that she was fired. But from the newspaper or the newspaper article, it was clear that the class were political propaganda.
 So it's not me, not for unregulation and not on Israeli-Palestinian issues.
 Thank you. So make the keyboard out of the classroom would be your conclusion in a way.
 I don't keep liberal trade out of the, or my views on liberal trade regimes and Trump out of the classroom.
 But really put it in the center of, put the Israeli-Palestinian or the undemocratic government or efforts of the government to rule.
 I prefer to keep it outside the classroom and serve as an example of somebody who is trying to be balanced.
 Because if the class is on on regulation, there is enough material to speak with the students beyond that.
 Thank you. Katarina, I mentioned your book chapter already.
 You wrote about empirical research in public administration and governance under authoritarian conditions of authoritarian practice.
 And I would like to just ask you to share a bit some of your lessons or insights and experiences. So what does it mean and in what way affects your abilities to do research?
 First of all, I would like to say that we were two authors, that we were trying to reflect on our experience, but also on the experience of other people.
 And there is a strong bias towards central and Eastern Europe and what we experienced there.
 And our reflection was done on several levels. Of course, the first level is the one that I guess all of us see as the first one and that is access to data.
 And that is not only in terms of that with authoritarian practices and that this is what we define that we are not really looking on the regimes, but practice that any liberal democracy can have some authoritarian practices.
 And this is one of the first things that is that data which in regular democracies are considered to be given that there is administrative data that are collected by bureaucracies and that are accessible to the researchers.
 This is not the case. That means that the data might be not collected at all, deliberately not collected or maybe manipulated, might be not really have the honest value as we would think it has.
 And our simply are very difficult to gain. And we as researchers have to then have various tactics. First of all, how to get this data, if they are or collect manually or even verify if this is truly so.
 We have to be really careful about who collects these data, how it's collected for what purpose and what does it mean for the data itself.
 And the same is also for people we are researching for the administrative relations. So we are interested in the people in the system.
 And to have access to these people is extremely difficult. And it takes a lot of time to build I would call trust networks.
 That means that if there is truly going to be access that I can rely on the validity of the data to get from the interviews or surveys.
 I have to be known to these people. And the people which has all again implications for the research itself because these are the networks that in particular in polarization have two camps.
 So if I have access to one network then I don't have the access to the other network. And what does it mean again for the reliability of the data and what we do with that.
 And so we try also to reflect on how can we in our research papers to reflect that because usually we are in the methodological chapter.
 We try to talk about what were the data etc. But we don't talk about the non data which are not there or what were the difficulties.
 And this is something that we try to urge that we should try we should start really reflecting about the silence about these data. So that's one level about the data.
 The other one is about the ethics and that is that again it is given that we we want to have informed consent. But in these countries informed consent means for many of the people that they sign that they are leaking information which can be very threatening.
 For the people inside of the system so how to go around that we should definitely not push because our primary task is really to protect people.
 So how can we deal with that.
 And then we try to also to assure that anonymity is the very important part but how to go around it.
 How to secure anonymity when some of the tools that we use might be not trusted.
 I for example don't trust my computer at the university so so I would not never put any data into my computer at the university.
 And this is just a simple thing to think about but I think it's very important to start a discussion about that because we take it as for granted that academia is independent.
 And also on conceptual level that is that it took also me a long time to realize that simply some concepts do not apply in very polarized and authoritarian type of countries.
 And then it's difficult to start reflecting upon that so what can we do about it and how can we really turn the coin and discuss the concepts that do reflect the reality.
 So these are the issues that we try to bring forward in the chapter and reflect upon that.
 Thank you. I think both dimensions so data collection issues as well as conceptual questions are very relevant also for the broader field of research of governance and public policy, public administration.
 And also particularly I think it's very important what you're saying that in recent decades you could say academia in general has moved to it's invested a lot of work a lot to it's improving on data security issues privacy data protection informed consent and what we call research ethics.
 But we learn from you and that is what I take that that is much more difficult to implement and to comply with these conditions that are often not required by funders for example right to in search under such conditions as you as you described them.
 I think that is an and very also important topic that deserves more attention and also discussion and David I would like to sort of bring you in here and ask you've been doing like research and regulatory governance for decades under all kinds of governments and what you see the similar experiences as Catalina what is your take on that.
 I guess I'm going to disappoint you I'm I don't I see just improvement in the last few decades my only complaints is too much regulation much of it come from ethics and accountability so it's better to have this kind of regulation then regulations that constraint my for other reasons right.
 So that's a lot of ethics integrity professionalism is very important so this probably the situation is is improving the environment is much bigger nowadays and so the years ago the number of people who are doing research the number of institutions the possibilities the ability to travel the ability to do research the funding it's it's really I think improving.
 From my point of view I'm speaking about the situation in Europe and the state as I know it and also of course in my country so it's really upsetting to see to hear.
 I'm coming now from a professor kind of visiting George source visiting professor at the CEO the school of the department of public policy and they will expect expelled from Budapest and so what I'm trying to say is it's not something new on this kind of difficulties we should be courageous we should be.
 Take the historical perspective and be confident that we can fight those people who need security security.
 And we should take some of the blame right we should always improve but the problem is the major problem is not with us not with regulatory state they prefer to yesterday and not with the with the academia.
 Many many problems but we can do it we can improve and we are improving via time sometimes I think we have too much money because money that was is given to higher education is not going to school or kingdom gardens and so on so we are privileged in some countries in some institution and so on with all those limitations.
 And we need to probably fight fight fight and opposite we will not pay too much for this fight.
 So we need to fight fight fight tackles and important another important part of this discussion and that is namely for what is the role for us as scholars and as an academic field how could we.
 That's a challenge the way we do we see our own role how we engage in public and what do we what we see as a task or essential role and purpose yeah role of of scholars right and that is Joe Joseph a question that I would have to you there has.
 Within this broader debate recently I think also been a bit of a discussion on what is it are we in what ways are we challenged as researchers as scholars in terms of how we speak publicly how we speak up what when we speak up in what way there is talk about school activism right so is there.
 Are there changes in the sort of in the rules or separation of roads between scholars and researchers on the one hand and more activists on the other hand or do you how do you see this.
 So one thing that has changed in this kind of role of scholars not in the classroom but we also citizens is that we live in very very polarized societies and very polarized discourse you either for us or against us.
 And also a degradation as a result of connected with us degradation of the quality of discourse we could call it the Twitter syndrome that people don't read a 27 page article or a 250 page book but they read tweets or blogs.
 And the result is I see it I'm a conscientious object to social networks as a forum for public discourse and I see the degradation even among colleagues that I respect because when I enter into this kind of information society public space they feed the polarization very short messages.
 Very black and white you either for us or against us so it's not just the problem of scholasticism you know sort of potentially abusing I'm a professor so you have to listen to me but degrading the quality of the discourse because when I go into the public space suddenly I.
 One forgets the cannons of academic discourse things are complex typically there's more great and there is black and white and that doesn't go down well and I see increasingly people our class of scholars succumbing to that that's what gets you heard the shorter and the more aggressive.
 Quote extreme unquote the message I put there the more reactions I will get the more quotes I will get et cetera so I think that's for me that's the real issue it's not the debate about scholasticism where in what way should a scholar present himself or herself when they go into the public sphere but how they do it and in great many cases it's just lamentable it's simplistic message.
 It's it's academic populism if you want.
 That is a new term or maybe a new concept thank you and Katarina you you are a professor in in a in a counter in in Slovakia right where the Fizzo government has moved really in recent years or maybe month more to really authoritarian practice.
 How does this Slovakian academia respond to that do you see changes in also sort of how people are how professors how faculty members behave publicly.
 First of all I would also like to say that authoritarianism in Slovakia academia but not only in Slovak but in central Eastern Europe behaves differently in academia because I at least think it is related to the way that that academic freedom is relatively recent if you look at it from the historical perspective.
 We were we were years of communism where academia was not free and I think that's still very visible or seen in the in in the current academia so there is not a clear cut answer that oh academia is a clear.
 Tower of discussion and for democracy etc because it wouldn't be true there academics and the polarization is also a man academics and there are universities that were established after the fall of communism.
 And so which do not provide what the academic world should provide that is bring knowledge forward and bring students and discuss and advance the knowledge some of these institutions are there to provide the degree for the politicians.
 And this means that the academic academia is divided not only that there are certain institutions which called themselves universities which I would never call them universities are within a university that has some tradition there are certain faculties or certain departments.
 So unfortunately there is not one front that we could rely and that also means that the polarization that fits abroad is visible inside very strongly and that is also visible how academics behave they are very careful about what they say how they say.
 But on the other hand there are also instances where where there is a clear discussion that yes democracy is something that we have to fight for and what what we what we need to put forward and I would like to bring forward this one instance that that united academia in at least Slovakia.
 And that is that fits are just last week cancelled holiday which commemorates the end of communism in Slovakia and it's called the holiday for democracy and fight against fascism or totalitarianism fascism and communism.
 And this holiday was cancelled and it was academia that spontaneously first one reactor came forward and said okay if it's cancelled we are going to grant students three day so that we can have events that would discuss democracy and other universities joined and now even private sector is joining okay we will grant three day to the party.
 And then we will grant three day to the people because we still think that from all the holidays we have to really this is this is the holiday that that's worth commemorating.
 And example that even in country where we're academia is split and there is no clear cut answer there is something that unites and that is that there is a clear threat that democracy can be lost or can can really be degradated.
 So I guess this was an unintended effect of fitza which meant that it united academia.
 Is there has there been a political response to that or a pushback by the government?
 It happened only yesterday and the day before yesterday so it's a very fresh thing that that happened.
 I would assume there will be pushback because unfortunately academia in central is dependent on politicians in many things not only in terms of grants but also in terms of how directors are elected it's not completely independent as it is in other countries.
 So I would expect that there will be some pushback but we will see what it will mean.
 Thank you David you mentioned earlier and you told us earlier that academia in Israel is sort of more on the more on the liberal end and it's also protesting or has been protesting against the government for the past decade I understand.
 And how does that has there been sort of political responses to that on academia or academics?
 The parliament is trying the right-wing parties in the parliament are trying but they are failing again and again to pass legislation.
 It's not a guarantee that they will continue to fail but there is all kind of efforts to make the academia more national in the same way.
 In the sense of just depressing anti-government speech or pro-peace speech but they are failing again and again into a extent that you don't find in some times in United States and even in Europe.
 So the Kremlin is really pushing out against government. Just to example we organized the petition, 4000 people from academia signed it.
 Another is the head of the president or director of the University in the South, Bergeva. If you know just boycott a ceremony for opening a new hospital where the because of the prime minister was there.
 So those are kind of actions that are going on and on for many years now but also being escalated in the last months.
 I think they defined this really academia. It's not everyone but it's a clear majority, 70% 80%.
 And some of my you were asking about the way I behave in class and I feel I need to explain myself better.
 Some of my colleagues would speak freely in class. They are not in the right precautions.
 But my point is if I want to bring my positions on injustice better to do it outside the class as a voluntary action.
 So I have webinars and tours. Not too many but I took the area academia to the territories. And I'm doing now a webinar on the silent transfer by the settlers in some of the areas of the West Bank.
 So I'm active but I'm trying to keep my sanity and really my it's really sanity by keeping my duties or my hobbies as a researcher, my identity as researcher.
 So both the Palestinians and the Israelis are threatening my capacity to keep my bubble, the sanity that I need so much to continue to handle my life.
 And this is my the way I do it myself.
 Thank you. May I just add one more question. So how do students respond to that? What is the expectations of students and their respect?
 So the student body is very diverse and some of them I'm meeting the demonstrations.
 There is one student here that came and gave a paper with me and walked in about two years. I didn't speak politics with her. And then I saw her in the demonstration.
 So the students are more conservatives and the faculty. The students the student body in Israel is very diverse compared to other countries because the share of population who is taking part in the Israeli academy is quite wide, especially with the college systems.
 But also the universities are now more diverse and more representative of the population than used to be before. And we don't have this elite universities to the same extent that you find in United States.
 It's a more European egalitarian system.
 But I don't know what Joseph is thinking things about that. Yes, he's on unique and clever way to look at us.
 So should I answer? Yes, please.
 So as academics, as professors, as scholars, we live or we should live with the fear of the reason that is intellectual.
 Terrible things are happening and you did nothing. History teaches us.
 So I'm in uncomfortable position because I tend to agree with you. That's we have to find something with which to disagree, David. Let's make sure that happens today.
 So on the one hand, one wants to speak out. I'm in the field of law. Ultimately, law is about justice.
 How can you not express your view? What is just or unjust? But the classroom is I'm also kind of old fashioned and danger species liberal.
 The classroom is a particular place because I am old, experienced with many quotes distinguished. I'm 74 years old. My students are 25 to 30 years old.
 And if I come out in the classroom with a very strong position on this so that I know that I will be squelching the kind of discussion that will be in class.
 People will not want to speak up and take a position against the professor. Seem to be siding with the bad guys. Seem to be whatever unprogressive.
 So I'm disciplined. I have one advantage which I never ever in my life have lectured. All my teaching is through discussion.
 So when students clamor, so what do you think about what's happening in Gaza, what's happening in Ukraine or any of these flashpoints.
 I say let's talk about it. And I invite the students to present their ideas. And I see my role as challenging them. So if somebody comes up with a very progressive idea, I will say, but what about this and what about that.
 And if somebody comes up with a conservative, I will see my role in saying, what about this and what about that.
 And try and encourage that kind of the view against polarization does not mean that you have to be a middle of the role that you cannot have your own very strong normative commitments.
 But in the classroom, I would consider it a successful class if all the points of you came out where the students were not intimidated or even encouraged to disagree with each other, etc.
 And I know the sounds kind of stupid, but I would like them to walk out of the class and say, so what does the professor think about this.
 And if they ask me, what do you think about this. Usually I say, well, you can go and read my op-eds or etc. But I wouldn't like in the classroom. I would think it's an abuse of my position of the kind of authority position in the classroom.
 So I think I'm afraid that David and I seem to be on the same page when it comes to the classroom. I want to say just one more word if I may on the raison des intellect.
 What's the real test for an academic for professor for scholar, the real test of courage.
 It's not to support loudly in the classroom, depending on your philosophy of teaching outside the classroom.
 An opinion which I suppose that if I were in Slovakia, I would be with you in protesting against the cancellation of the day of democracy and all the rest.
 But the real test and it's very, very rare. It's to go against your reference group. That takes courage.
 When your reference groups expects you a good card holding liberal or you're a good card holding conservative, etc.
 And you have to go against your reference group where people would say, "Did you see what Wailer said? How can..." And there's so little of that. It's so easy to say the right things where you will get three cheers from your reference group or if you're on social network a lot of likes.
 It's so much more difficult. And that's the real test of courage to go against your reference group.
 So you can see that there's no easy way we have to navigate. When we get to the end of life, I don't know, the end of life, I want to be able to say to myself, "Nobody can accuse me in a serious way that I committed to raison des intellectuell."
 But it's not easy in navigating this thing, in being both a responsible teacher and at the same time being a responsible citizen with points of view and fighting for a just society.
 So there are no easy answers. And very often we will find ourselves agonizing, "Was this the right position to..." I usually don't agonize what is the right position to take. But did I express it in the right forum? Did I express it in the correct way? Did I show that things are two more minutes?
 The president of Colombia was criticized very severely when Colombia capitulated to the Trump thing.
 And I actually, first of all, I thank God that I'm not a president of a university anymore, that I don't find myself with the challenges that now they face.
 But having had that experience, you see the world in a different place. So when we had a faculty discussion, we should not capitulate, etc.
 I'll tell you what I said. I said that in the university environment, we tenured professors of the most protected class.
 Colombia would have had to have fired between 700 and 1000 people if they had said no to Trump immediately and long term even more.
 There wouldn't be a single professor who was fired. It would be the secretaries, the porters, the administrators, the lab thing.
 Now if you are president of Colombia, it would be very easy. I'm not saying if he took the right or wrong decision. But I just know that it's not an easy decision.
 Okay, I can show, etc. I won't pay the price. My professors won't pay the price. But I will have to fire between immediately, between 700 and 1000 of the most vulnerable people in my academic community.
 That's not an easy decision to take. So I'm glad that I didn't have to take that decision.
 And when we had the discussion in my faculty and people said if this comes to NYU and it will come to NYU because we are on the list of ten, I said if you say we should not capitulate, etc.
 I want you to say at the same time that if the cuts come you will resign. That it will not only be the vulnerable people who pay the price for taking the right position and resisting the administration.
 And I don't believe a single one of my colleagues would resign.
 Thank you. I think you were all sort of outlined the difficult positions leaderships, academic leaderships are put into.
 And I think that is also an important discussion to have. Maybe in a second step I would like to go back to what you said about the classroom and about teaching and about how we could think about students and our programs also.
 And what we experience here at the the Heddy School is also in recent in the past roughly two years but probably that has goes back longer we are just more aware of it in the past two years is that students increasingly find it difficult to discuss these contested topics.
 So they lack the instruments and the skills to really discuss among one another but also in the classroom these topics where they feel unsafe about or where they expect contestation.
 And I think that is something that challenges us as educators but also puts us in an important, puts a lot of responsibility on us in order to enable that type of dialogue.
 And Katarina I would like to bring you in here because maybe you can cause some disagreement or bring some disagreement here to the podium when it comes to the classroom. How is your experience from from teaching and being in the classroom in and such a bit of a polarized contested environment.
 First of all, I would like to come one minute back and that is that I expected our academia to be more articulated and that example that I gave that was the first time that it was articulated so that was why I was so happy about it that finally academia did find some some common voice.
 All the other articulations are more individuals within the academia which is I think a totally different thing and I think that we do have a responsibility towards society also to lead discussion.
 And when the academia is silent then this is not a good sign of academia so that that was my position about really being happy that the director did voice what the academia was thinking about the cancellation of the holiday.
 And I fully agree what what you mentioned and that is that students do not have or do not equipped with with discussing and polarization brought hatred and violence also in language and the way how contested issues are approached and it is visible also in the classes.
 And we do have one third of my students are Ukrainians and it's difficult if the class is polarized that then there is also tendency not to sit with Ukrainians if there is a critical strength and send and my role is really to put them together and to start a discussion which cannot be done on the contested issues of course.
 But to have classes organized in such a way that there is discussion and discussion on not easy topics either but not contested either topic either and these are mostly very related and I think this is a very important task that that at least I have introduced or started to introducing in much bigger extent and that is that.
 Whenever possible and we have an outside speaker and we have internships or we have simulations or we have hands on tasks we try to look on every issue from the perspective of values what can be done and what can be seen there how how we
 approach the values how we identify what what are they and what does it mean for us as citizens or us as students are as bureaucrats and since we are having classes that relate to bureaucracy a lot these are segments that that are discussed and I think that
 this is one issue that that really is very important in terms of discussion and the second is also building some some relations this this
 uprootness I don't know what it is in English that that we lose the roots with the community it is something that that again it can be discussed and simulated in the class is how
 community outreach how how networks can be built that are not based on contested issues and I think this is something that that is important in the class bringing back values I think that is that is also an important I think
 important discussion in the broader in the social sciences because I think and that is concerns how we set up our programs design our curriculum because I think it law is different in that regard but across public policy programs
 public science public administration over the past few decades we have sort of focused a lot in in educating or training our students in quantitative skills
 economics coding programming and all of this and the question David and I would be interested in hearing you view on that have we gone too far maybe and do we need to go back or refocus and bring back values and normative analysis more on
 the policy to programs of public administration public policy public science compared to what we've done in the past two decades maybe.
 Thank you for the question I'm not sure again the time the right person to answer I do feel that quantitative experimental modeling are very important
 but I also recognize that they have the costs in terms of missing the macro picture not only the normative but what is all about when you are
 and it's natural when you focus on data on metal you miss the theory you miss the the big picture and I think I can see it everywhere including here and we need we should be should be careful about it the problem is not only in teaching it's also in research the way we practice research
 but it occurred to me that her school is is very is a good place to ask what are you doing about all those questions and you are the graduate then and the way you ask the question it seems that I'd like to hear what you have to say and to share your experience
 that would mean I would leave my moderator role that came all to up in the previous round table before the lunch but what we the way we try to think embedded in our correct or have embedded in our curriculum development is through interdisciplinary is having our programs designed as interdisciplinary programs where we have law, public policy, public management and statistics as well as economics as the foundational course of the way we are going to do that.
 So we are going to do the foundational courses across the programs still I think we are we are we should have more of a discussion is that is that the best composition for the challenges we are facing today.
 So I think that just recently in a conversation from student was also that they want more from the student side more history of public administration history of the state nation development political philosophy political theory which we do not have do not focus a lot on in our curriculum so I see there's also a bit of demand from the student side and I understand Joseph.
 So I think that is a good example of what I think is the way we are facing the student side and what we are facing is the way we are facing the student side and what we are facing is the way we are facing the student side.
 So I think that is a wrong or unpopular position I said a university should not have a position on anything as such except when there's an attack on the idea of the university.
 So the university should not have a position on Ukraine but that doesn't mean that academia doesn't have because the university doesn't but the professors academics can have a position and should have a position.
 But I resisted any attempt to say the university should make a statement that what's happening in Ukraine is terrible etc.
 I said speak out for yourself right up edge etc. The only time the university should take a position as an institution it's when the idea of the university itself is under attack.
 So the way I'm problematizing it is to say that the word academia is a little bit too broad.
 We can make a distinction between academia institutionally speaking and academics.
 The second point which is banal and a little bit tried but I happen to believe in it. So I since I teach law I also teach theology these are two disciplines which are repeat with values.
 So I tell my law students you cannot just ask yourself what is the law you have to take a position whether the law is a just law is an unjust law etc. So you have to values are terribly important but I'm not going to feed you the values which you should believe in.
 I'm just going to give you the tools for which you will make up your own mind. So I want you always to take a position a normative position but don't look for me to give you the normative position just look to me to give you the tools to think about it in a complex because normativity is usually complex.
 To give you the tools to think about it then take a position don't just say I'm like social scientist value free there's no such thing value free also in law there's no such thing you know positives and well the law is the law is the law let's move on.
 But I'm not don't look to me to tell you what are the values that you should cherish and there you're right that's our role as educators we can improve the normative toolkit not just the analytical toolkit but the normative toolkit how to think about values in a more sophisticated a deeper more profound way but I don't regard it as my role to say and this is the right position from a normative point of view.
 I know that's been out but I said last little sneaky comment your colleagues who go into the class and you know speak their mind et cetera.
 I don't want to condemn them because I can see there can be a but I always have the suspicion that they might not be so interested in the educational value but interested in feeling good about themselves.
 Quick response before we open the floor to the audience they would or not.
 I always felt that the radical left and the radical right have something in common which is and this commonality is is intolerance right but also safe rightness right to right to snest whatever you know what I mean.
 So I agree but again what do you do in order to teach the students here in her to speak to debate to take the time because we don't have this class we don't have this cori column.
 So what we did in the past two years is indeed we were offering instead of workshops on that were indeed titled how to talk about contested issues so that was but that was not academic works not academic classes or seminars it was more skills workshop workshops I would I would call them for like a couple of hours or also over the weekend and there was one second was also that we're not going to talk about the next.
 And that is again not teaching but it's way of talking to students about it is that we include in our welcome week include a workshop of a few hours to students on you know how to formulate a position in an intercultural environment and we're in a diverse environment in a way that it resonates with others and that is respectful and that it complies with sort of standards of an.
 Good academic debate so that that's the type of thing it's very nice but still we have to think if skills like that should be part of the curriculum or stay you know marginal part.
 And I would experiment with putting it into the curriculum I know that the curriculum is we have limited number of hours and so on and then we also faculty right which faculty will teach us also a problem.
 But yes I think that is indeed the discussion we should have at public policy and public policy programs and schools but with that I would also like to open the floor looking at the time for some questions and comments and I see Kai here first.
 So I would collect Kai first and please introduce yourself with your question.
 Hello good afternoon my name is Kai Kai, from the Art School here I want to thank the panel I have two concrete questions but I would start with the remark to David.
 I thank you very much for your remarks and how you are positioned and how you feel as a scholar in Israel it's not about only what you said but how you said that it really is felt here and it's very important that you did the right thing.
 Thank you for that and two concrete questions the first one is simple if one organization or set of organization is under attack the question one could ask is with whom to build coalitions.
 So what would be ways to forge coalitions with other actors to strengthen the position of of universities under attack.
 The other one is a little bit more complicated and goes back to the discussion you just had about normative perspectives and values and when you talk about it professor Viler I assume that because it's in law there is a clear set of perspectives that are in the background of a socratic debate between students.
 When I think about our field public policy or our field here regulation and governance I wonder do we have this compass and I also wonder to what extent our research and our concepts have normative connotations that are not really explicit and that's why we cannot teach them in a socratic way because we're not even aware of them.
 So the concrete question I like to ask is then to to David in the development of scholarship on regulation regulatory governance and maybe beyond that public policy as well.
 Do we need to be more normative in the sense that we really openly discuss what are the normative foundations of specific empirical perspectives of specific comments we do that links to the discussion we had with Micha yesterday about kind of the kind of victim blaming that me a little bit that the.
 Attacks on the regulatory state are to some extent an own goal because expert driven decision making is exclusive and this type of arguments he made but in relation to our discussions about higher education and and the classroom here I mean where do we check what what are the normative foundations and what kind of
 foundations are behind such things as oh an independent regulatory agency is a good thing right it's not good when it's not independent yet really why so have a very simple discussion of that is hard for us because we don't have the normative content that's really weak.
 It's the product of our education and specialization and so on.
 Can we collect just a few questions that was yes. Thank you my name is Anna Moskal and for the context I did two masters in Poland and I moved to Australia so Katarina I can definitely confirm that what you said about Slovakia is also seen in other central Eastern European countries and if I can ask you a question because I want
 to be coming from post-communist country who also struggle with our Russian neighbor whether your view on universities and that shouldn't take a stand about Ukraine is the same as Joseph or whether you think that universities should take a stand given how many millions of Ukrainian students we have.
 First row and then I would say we give it back first and then take a second. Hi then in Kulena and another central European who moved to the other side of the world to New Zealand just for the context because the question is that not all countries are or have sort of slid into the authoritarian or kind of polarized pathway as far as the three examples
 of the panel members represent. So I just wonder for those who are somewhat lucky that they are not yet that far. What would you recommend academics and universities to do are there any actions that we could take in New Zealand Australia where the polarization is not so extreme at least not yet to make the society is more resilient and to help to preserve the democratic freedom.
 The academic freedoms. You know something that you maybe regret that you haven't had sort of the vision to do a bit earlier and then maybe just a short comment on the on the kind of question it.
 There even in New Zealand there are attempts to start the culture wars and the polarizations and what was an interesting situation is that regulatory impact assessment you know something that we think of as very technocratic tools became a forum where the public servants told the government the party in the coalition that is pushing the culture war narratives.
 These are bad ideas don't do it stuff it and the media picked up on it you know so all of a sudden something that we discuss at these conferences or maybe another example would be the Australia's regulation of access of kids under 16 to social networks it's another technocratic pragmatic regulatory things.
 It's part of defending the democracy is it becoming a lot more important in a context that we probably don't think about regulatory tools having a role so that's just a comment that you know we are becoming a conference about defending democracy and tools that are left perhaps.
 Yes I would agree increasingly we've been discussing over the past or since yesterday the sort of the link between regulation and democracy and they sort of interlinkages but there were comments I think our questions for all three of you why would we not start from here and then go over there.
 I think I better because I agree with you with the premise of what you say I would just pass that.
 I'm the part of the curriculum please.
 I will start with what I think we collectively underestimated in central Eastern Europe and that is the degree of conspiracies and hybrid word that that was going on and that we noticed too late.
 And what I regret is that I personally also think I could have done more in the classes in terms of how to work with the resources to to realize whether you are working with.
 Regular resources are conspiracies because they are really difficult to distinguish when you so I really regret and I think that collective blame for academia but I would go even further I think that even you have made it the extent of the hybrid word that that was going on in central Eastern Europe.
 I guess that is also a count for what the contested issues are that some of the contested issues are related to this and that's when there is also a tech on students and how they can speak or teachers how can they speak I think that it is the role of institution.
 University to say something and that's why I also think that that we have a certain commitment to have and provide the education also for Ukrainian students.
 And when that is again attacked I think that it is again not only academia but institution that that should speak up.
 Thank you Joseph recommendations or wisdom maybe for our New Zealand or Australia.
 I want to say one comment on the discipline.
 It's true that the very essence of the legal discipline is contestation. The students learn every case that goes before court there will be a lawyer arguing one side and arguing another side so contestation.
 We often in the classroom say what are the strongest arguments against this position because you you don't know which side you will find yourself.
 Because student come in the first semester of their law studies they realize every case there's a five to four decision of the Supreme Court. You can argue on this side and that side and it corrodes their belief that there can be actually a normative position because everything has two arguments to it.
 So on the one hand it encouraged contestation and questioning on the other hand it corrodes a kind of normative commitment. Okay you can argue but it doesn't mean that there's no from a normative point of view right or wrong.
 So it's both an advantage of the legal discipline but also a disadvantage because our students become normatively corroded. They just don't believe everything has two sides to it so there's no actual side there's no truth there's no right and wrong.
 I will tell you a real dilemma so take the protests the occupations the camps etc. And there again I took an unpopular position in that debate in my university.
 Why did I take it because I think a university is a special place when you go into a church you take off your hat because you're going into a church.
 You feel that you desperate to pee but you won't walk into a cemetery and pee in a cemetery because there's a certain dignity to the place.
 The university is also there's a certain canon of behavior in a university you want to protest pick at the university go into the public square with etc.
 But when you walk into the university you leave your megaphone outside it's not who speaks loudest it's argument reason that should prevail.
 That's why I said all the protests people with strong normative commitments and sometimes I agreed with the normative commitment but when you walk into the precincts of the university just as in a church you take your hat off in a university you leave your megaphone outside it's not who shouts loudest.
 Imagine that in every controversial normative position there would be an occupation because people feel and we want people to have strong normative commitment.
 So I said the university imposes a certain discipline and that's why I was against the occupations the protest that actually disrupted what I think is the correct what the university should do.
 It's not who speaks loudest but whose arguments are the strongest and there's a tension between the two.
 With other so I thought I think it was if or first then we move over to there and then Martin.
 Thank you. You did an app at Utrecht University the Netherlands so I really appreciate this discussion and openness with which you've talked about your dilemmas.
 I'm sometimes a bit jealous of our human rights colleagues scholars because they can apply their am I loud enough should I speak louder they can apply their.
 No I'm just deaf. No but I would like you to hear so they can apply their scholarship very easily to what's going on and say this is a violation of human rights and and I'm looking for ways or I would like to hear your thoughts about ways in which regulatory governance scholars could do within their discipline.
 Research that keeps the rule of law alive or at least contribute to the debate so it's wondering what your thoughts were about our research agendas so for example two examples that came to my mind when we discuss trust in government like we often do when we research that should we maybe if we would do that in Israel not do more effort to investigate the trust of Palestinian citizens this is not the right thing.
 And citizens in the Israeli government or Dutch voters for here at Wilders in the Dutch government for example well I had another example I leave it.
 Thank you. Thank you very much if I had played a university of Mac the book and first a small question because we focused so much on the classroom.
 I think already 15 years ago at an Ipsan Canada certain college didn't get into the country one Ipsan I think was moved from Turkey to Poland last minute because of political.
 Term or was the DCPR it was it was but the real reason was publishers couldn't get the books in and therefore the organizer decided to remove so we sidestepped that ethical decision I still have the email all right so so it was it was important at the time Poland was the place to flee to.
 And so what about I mean we have retrenchment in the global environment and not another real question is you distinguish between academics and academia but I think we have to be worried more about academia as it was at is is and it will be.
 Because if you have that retrenchment that's a natural position we tend to say less the critical the the the falling out of line of your peer group becomes more painful maybe dangerous look at my university in Germany.
 Where you think things are safer not I see the I see the self.
 In 1964 German TV and she says in in 1933 when the elections took place we were not surprised by the Nazis but all my academic colleagues turned that back on me that was the real reason I'm not so sure academia is is.
 I think that is in academia without judgment and therefore when we speak about academic freedom due to issues of culture war or of what what we are we allowed to say how do we send ourselves a normative service and then that's a different issue external state intervention to block academic freedom we tend to and you don't do that what we tend to speak about can we say what we want to say that's not the topic.
 We have three and thank you all three scholars of personal conviction and and compass academia such does not have personal compa in that sense how do we how can do we don't we need some kind of single elements you put up as standards for what we define as academic freedom it can't be just we can say what we want to say it's not that it comes with responsibilities it comes with.
 It comes with as it comes with and I think that's also the thing it doesn't come and we had that debate in Germany as well with the very democratic candidate and that you're in cover to set but in science there are different views and all sides have to be right now that's not academia it is the better argument in the contestation and that's it that's the end of that so so what about academia in the largest sense and don't we have to define what academic freedom then is.
 And it's limits more than just being able to speak more about the responsibility in that which individuals can have but don't we need more.
 Yes hello Martin Lodge LSC I've got one sort of two completely opposite views I think here but one is some elements here as I really knew or as a eternal to the debate about what is the university I mean reading our on real duskies experience of 1968 on my LSC 4 fathers fighting it out whether it should be a gate to the senior common room with the activist scholar on the one hand with the student union.
 And the other social democratic people thinking that shouldn't be the case you know it seems to me the role of what is a scholar is an eternal debate in these things and we are so part of this debate I think we still have and my colleagues who believe that teaching is to give voice to the suppressed rather than something else right there you know they have a pedagogical statement even which I have to do with so so one question is to what extent is this 1968.
 Revisited to some extent in the debates and I'm too young to really have a judgment on that the other question is sort of well one to Joseph Vila in particular when we talk about contestation but is it not also important to study where the boundaries of the contestation are and where they move.
 So while I might disagree with you and so we can study you know a disagreement at one point in time would we not notice possibly that's the boundaries on our disagreements the justifications we take the backing these things so the reference point on which we base our arguments that Ziza shifting I mean is that a way to come back to the studying the boundaries of contestation what is acceptable or what is not acceptable in a moment.
 So I think it's not acceptable in a liberal democracy rather than suppression point I don't know whether that makes sense but the other question is is the university inherently an elite project because you could an elite project so should we you know it's a sacred place and should we stay in there and do our stuff because you might say all public policy schools my place is a case in point we were created as an evening school for civil servants possibly local government officials to basically improve the state of municipal government.
 So we are a state of municipal waste and all that where we now 45,000 pounds you know kind of similar audience we don't teach that sort of thing any more not enough money in it you might even extend the classroom when I'm not talking digital here we're talking here extending the classroom to the 14 year old if not the 80s so should this classroom we're thinking about should we extend it is that's a role or are we an elite project.
 Thank you so why would we not start the other way.
 Lots of questions.
 When are we meant to finish?
 Three minutes ago.
 I know everybody sitting here believes in the rule of law except when it comes to respecting the times in conferences aren't we. So yes these are eternal problems so to speak.
 And we don't expect to have categorical answers so in the value of discussion with something that connects so they are no human rights that are absolute.
 Really.
 So some things are talking about you know the limits.
 There's an easy limit. I would not allow a professor came and taught that the earth is flat.
 That seems to me to be an easy case but beyond that it becomes difficult in the United States in the name of freedom of expression a bunch of neo Nazis can march with the protection of the police through a neighborhood of Jewish survivors.
 In Germany they would be put in prison before they even took the first step in that direction. It's not easy to decide or denial of the Holocaust in some countries in Europe it's a crime to deny the Holocaust.
 I happen to feel that that's an absurd position to take but at least so it's very difficult when it comes to those boundaries.
 Except if you take really obvious cases to decide exactly where would be those boundaries but you are right that we should discuss the dilemma of setting boundaries and people will take positions some people here would think yes denial of the Holocaust should be a crime.
 People like me will explain why this is not a good idea at all for a variety of reasons. So with that I tend to to agree that we should not eliminate the idea that there are limits to rights.
 And one has to discuss in some cases we will just result in a disagreement and it's also historically.
 Historically conditioned just one last comment on the rights culture.
 I don't want to live in a country that doesn't protect fundamental rights but you have noticed how the discourse of duty has practically disappeared.
 We always talk about rights and more rights and more rights but we never talk about duties duties of citizens towards society etc.
 You know the famous book of Dwalking taking right seriously.
 So almost as an act of protest I gave a seminar last year which was called taking duty seriously and I did it in the context of climate control.
 Let's talk about climate control not with the vocabulary of rights but with the vocabulary of duties because it's so rare to find both in the academic literature and in public discourse as long as you don't violate criminal law and pay your taxes you're okay.
 And that can't be the good society that we believe in.
 But these questions were profound and we would need another seminar to really go into them in that so I'll keep my mouth shut now.
 Thank you Joseph Katarina.
 I think the question of elitism within universities can be questioned in context where we know already that 40% of the population are the age of these people are already going to the universities and the universities are free so basically really anybody can go to the universities are there still an elitist project that's
 a question.
 And towards the boundaries I think that we have already seen here that we are fighting about the boundaries for you it's really the flat earth.
 For me it's when somebody says which is happening in Slovakia where I expected the response of the university that vaccination does not work and should not be done at all not only COVID at all.
 So is it the role of the university to speak up or not or the academic university or so academic in the university.
 Oh and that's a question because that's probably one way we disagree on.
 So finally some disagreement.
 And I guess it goes back to also the conspiracies because where do they start and where do they end and where do we where the academics academia and the university should talk or not to talk about where is the evidence on what is the role of the evidence and bring it back.
 Bring the discussion back to positions but if the discussion is not about positions then isn't it our role to bring it to the positions.
 It's difficult because I'm the last one and I want to say something wise but I still need I have something to say which is not necessarily wise or so much clever.
 So I was intrigued by Martin, Martin's thinking about the university as a elite project and say what happened in the 20th century it moved from a lead project to a state project in the positive and negative way and we are fighting to keep this elite idea of what is the university within this state project and there is you know in different states there is this space to keep the idea of the university.
 But at the same time being the servant of the servant of the state economic development training also professional school including public school but not only.
 And then the humanities are still struggling and the future of the university is the future of humanities and we need to keep the humanities there lively and kicking which means political theory, political philosophy, history within our school, professional school with the part which is growing and also the sciences, the art sciences, computer and so on.
 Now the last thing about Judith question what do you do in order to bring more normative aspect the way I personally solved it is to develop three years ago starting to develop and it's gradually a course on injustice and redress and I think the public policy schools do not take or give into social justice enough.
 In just this, not only injustice teaching injustice and analyze it in social science theory but also what how do you redress injustice and what and we have a if I were thirty years younger maybe I was start walking on redress as a project for public policy how do you how do you redress you cannot.
 Bring the desk from wherever they are you cannot bring them to life right but there are so many people who are hurt and suffer and experience injustice can be a very small injustices interaction with the teachers or child abuse and so on and those issues are not part of our world and the public can be.
 So injustice and redress class that I give a seminar and so on. Thank you.
 Thank you David for also for sharing this experience and about this class.
 We are way over time so rather than having like a closing round and a question I would just like to take the opportunity to thank all of you for very openly sharing your views and experiences.
 What I take away from this discussion is a couple of things first we could probably have gone on much longer and take on more of the larger questions as well so fundamental challenges to the role of university can be discussed in very many ways and with very many sort of sub questions.
 What I also take away and that is related is even though the context all three contexts are very different many of the questions that are currently discussed in each of your context are then similar right and also resonate with other context that are here represented in the room which probably which also I think gives gives is food for thought and food for more discussions.
 So just a few started in your very early in this conversation today you were saying well maybe we should also that is at least how I understood you be a bit more self critical as universities or scholars or academics or academic institutions and have self critical discourse about what is maybe the contribution of academic or has been the contribution of academic institutions
 to the polarization into the anti-illotism that we are seeing which also I think would be would open room and space for just another like 90 minutes discussion.
 So I think there is much more of course to discuss we probably will do this as we as you are referring to as we survive hopefully all of this and one way and that is now really the closing here one way or one option what we could discuss all of this is of course
 tomorrow's panels but also tonight at the dinner so remember there is a dinner conference dinner at seven in the Alte Tuanhalle in Belen Friedrichsign everyone is of course invited and that would be a venue for further discussion but for now please and applause for the three speakers thank you very much.
