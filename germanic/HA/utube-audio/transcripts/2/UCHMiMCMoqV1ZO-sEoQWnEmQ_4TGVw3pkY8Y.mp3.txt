 Ich glaube, wir können es starten. Hallo und willkommen zu heute ist es in der Stelle, um die Zeit des Frank-Ko-German-Aktions in der Weg oft ein eröffnen Gloverorder.
 Heute ist die finale Event der Pariserplatz-Dialog-Series, die Frank-Ko-German-Dialog-Series, sehr kindly supported by the Federal Foreign Office.
 Und just last week we met with 145 guests from France, Germany, and beyond at the Pariserplatz in Berlin to explore some of Europe's most pressing issues today from industrial policy and the new MFF to geopolitics and defense, digital sovereignty and coalitions of the willing as a means to overcome political deadlock.
 Und heute ist das Online-Diskussion, wir konvergtene some of these topics, always with the overarching question of how France and Germany can meet the way in addressing the unprecedented convergence of threats that Europe is currently facing.
 Ich bin zu Neuen, Acting Director of the Jack-Bloß Center in Berlin, und ich bin sehr happy to moderate this excellent panel today with Daniela Schwarz, Executive Board Member of the Bedsman-Schriftung.
 Shahin Vallee, Senior Associate Fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations, and Georgina Wright, Special Advisor to the President and Senior Fellow at the German Marshal Fund of the United States.
 Hallo Daniela Schaun, und Georgina. Hallo, everyone. - Hello.
 Very good to have you.
 Ich möchte mit einem sehr braunen Bildschirm an, wo wir stehen, wo Europe stands. So ist das eine Art, wo wir uns in der USA schicken, nicht nur in der Trans-Saggolantik-Relations-Ship mit der neuen, nötigen, stetschlichen Städte, nur die Läddez-Evidence,
 aber auch in der Schrift, von der Städte zu der Städte und der Städte zu der Städte zu der Städte zu erfolgen.
 Und auch ein der these issues by itself, ist eine sehr große Challenge.
 Jetzt haben wir die drei Konvergene.
 Ist die EU equipped to address all three threats simultaneously, und Daniela perhaps you would like to start? - Thank you, too, first of all, for having me, and then also for laying out the land and the way you did,
 because I indeed think that the European Union is facing quite existential threats to the way it is organized and the way it has managed itself in the world, because what we are serving are global changes, which challenge together with other developments, three dimensions of European order.
 One is the security order, and you mentioned Russia's war against Ukraine, but also the China dimension has a security element, so there's this big topic.
 Then the economic order is really under challenge, because the old assumptions that Europe is embedded into a globalizing world economy, where Europe has a competitive edge,
 and can successfully deal with other major markets and run a surplus in doing that.
 This is also now really strongly challenged, both by US protective measures and also by first of all Chinese protectionism, but also Chinese overproduction and its competitive gains.
 So in terms of thinking about our economic model, Europe is also under a major threat, and the third element was really, again, emphasized with the US National Security Strategy published last week,
 our democratic model of governance is also under threat, both within, because we see a rise of non-democratic actors, and from externally through very clear interventions in our democratic spheres.
 Now Europe can deal with those threats and challenges, but I believe it has to do much better than it has shown over the past month. We see an acceleration of certain policies and also new policies kind of put to the forefront, which weren't in the initial five year outlook of the European Commission.
 So quick moves now on critical minerals, more measures on economic security. I hope measures to deepen the European financial market, because if we don't manage to protect and make our economy more competitive, we won't be able to protect ourselves, we won't be able to gain tech sovereignty.
 So we will also be detrimental to our democracy, because social economic policy in member states remains crucial to give people the impression that they are well put into democratic systems and open societies.
 So I want to zoom in into this economic challenges, but also security challenges and tech challenges a bit later Shaheen, can Europe do what the Neurah says that you need to do? Is it capable of acting on so many fronts at once?
 I think it is entirely capable of doing so, but it is held back by a couple of things. One is two sets of pretty extraordinary dependencies, but dependency for its own security on the US, which continues to hold back Europe from maybe mounting a more muscular response to the US's trade policy against the EU, for instance.
 And I think the fact that Europe is so heavily dependent on the US for the purpose of defending Ukraine, for instance, is a critical vulnerability that I think explains a lot the European complacency.
 The other is an extreme dependency on China, and a dependency on China that is accelerating, and it used to be an export dependency in particular of Germany. And that export dependency is now turning into what you have called a second China shock.
 And I think that second China shock cannot be underestimated. I think Europe in general and Germany in particular has downplayed its importance. And I think there is a very acute need now of a radical change in economic policy to respond to it.
 It is quite striking when you think about it that a year and a half ago when the EU embarked on imposing new tariffs on electric vehicles, the German government abstained on that decision.
 And I think that the EU abstained on what is perhaps the most important economic policy decision that the EU took for the purpose of Germany and the German industrial sector. It abstained because it was internally divided. And it was internally divided because also the German car industry and the industrial sector on the whole was unclear about what to do.
 And I think that the EU was at the time a strong fear by the car industry lobby that if we were to impose European tariffs on Chinese vehicles, the German car sector which had invested so heavily in China would be treated as a Chinese car maker in Europe and as a European car maker in China and potentially losing on both fronts.
 And I think that the EU has the impression that that thinking in Germany is evolving slowly but it has not yet turned into a new policy which I think needs to be rooted in higher tariffs on Chinese goods where the EU believes that it can compete and where it must for national security reasons, maintain some domestic production capacity.
 The auto sector is probably one of them and the other is combined that with a bi-European preference or basically another way of saying it is a European industrial policy.
 I think these are words that a few months ago were very much taboo across Europe, potentially even more so in Germany. I think they remain taboo is still some parts of Brussels, I think talking about industrial policy with DG trade or DG Comp remains something that is quite difficult.
 But I think this is changing fast so the EU was about to introduce today which we could have talked about the EU Industrial Accelerating Act. This has been postponed to late January but so I think there is some movement.
 But I think that is very necessary. The reason why this is difficult to is because it is difficult and we have experienced it when we were trying to devise a European response to the Inflation Reduction Act.
 It is difficult to devise a true European industrial policy when we only have national fiscal resources to do that.
 That was the big problem with the IRA. We ended up not having a European response to the IRA but rather a set of national responses that were enabled by a weakening of the state-aid framework.
 I think the question now is can we do better with the European Industry Acceleration Act? I think that is the big question.
 It takes us back to the perennial question of Europe's fiscal integration. Can we put together European fiscal resources to devise a new economic policy?
 I think that is the fundamental challenge for Europe. I think it can definitely overcome these obstacles but my fear is that it may not be able to overcome these obstacles nearly fast enough.
 I think the speed of the economic shock that is hitting us is astounding and sadly the speed of our reaction does not match.
 That is the big challenge for us to basically accelerate our change of attack so that we can mount an effective response.
 Maybe we can talk a bit more about that in the Q&A.
 Before we get to that, Georgina Shaheen says Europe is too slow. We are not acting in the speed that we need to match the speed of the challenges thrown at us.
 As global norms and principles erode, what does it take for the EU to not just survive but really be able to shape global developments and uphold its own values?
 Someone at Paris Applaus suggested that perhaps the times are gone when the EU was able to impose its own standards or when it comes to trade agreements for example.
 Do you agree?
 Thank you. I am just going to switch to a broad agreement with the two speakers which is never good on a panel and I am sure there will be a further downline but completely agree on the diagnosis.
 To answer your question simply, I think we are living through a moment where these norms are no longer taken for granted even inside the EU. They are certainly not taken for granted if you look at the United States and China but they are even being debated inside the EU.
 I think that those are hard conversations. There is a lot of reckoning to be had.
 When you talk to senior democrats in the US they say we don't get it. You have done the right diagnosis, you have the drug report, you have the letter of poor. Why aren't you acting on it? Why are you so slow?
 The point that Shaheen says which is we are getting there but we are simply not able to act fast enough. That is a major holding back the EU from influencing the board.
 I hear a lot when I have conversations with diplomats from countries around the world. They feel that the EU has lost its confidence and it is not surprising given all the challenges that Daniela set out with the US and China and then also politically and internally.
 If you are not clear on what norms you are trying to defend it is going to be difficult to have those conversations. You also need to have more conversations with like minded partners and be much more willing to listen to what they want.
 Before there was this sense of almost normative grandeur like we have high standards and we are going to bring everyone to the world. There are conversations that we can have with partners that don't share everything that we do but are willing to deepen trade of order, access to raw materials.
 We can invest massively in their infrastructure. Having more of those conversations and listening to what they want is really necessary and accept Daniela and Shaheen said this except that the world is very different.
 There is always a tendency in many parts of the EU to be like what we need is more Europe but that is unparalleled to a lot of Europeans. They don't necessarily want us to have more of a role.
 There is a complexity where you need EU-wide decisions but actually member states decide and they hold the fiscal purse. I was quite encouraged by the recent EU's economic security strategy which actually put forward concrete ways of creating an agency or a body where you could have national regulators or representatives of national ministries of the economy and finance to exchange intelligence and best practice.
 That is a good way of stepping stone but it is better than automatically advocating for the members and members' state decisions and make everything at the EU level.
 We are in a radically different environment and that forces us to revisit our competition rules, trade rules and markets. It requires deep and green expertise to have a supply chain and to be an investor.
 Sometimes I worry that even officials in EU departments and DG use perhaps lacking that expertise and that is no criticism of them. It is just the world is very different. We need to find ways to have expert groups or subconsumments to DG use from the business sector or think tanks.
 The leadership question is key. I really sense the leadership vacuum at the EU right now. I don't think Vondelaire is as strong as she used to be. France is obviously very weak domestically and completely consumed by domestic politics, Mertzs and well two Germans on the panel.
 I don't know if I am going to speak for Germany but it feels like we are varying to a point where decisions are going to be shaped by smaller groups of member states. That small group will depend on the issue and that will then they will shape the decision and push it at the EU level.
 I think we just need to accept that that is the direction we are going into. On some subjects we are going to have to include non-EU voices as well as part of that conversation. It is deeply uncomfortable for all the reasons that we know but I think it does require a change in approach if we are going to respond quickly to the multiple challenges we face.
 Thank you, Georgina. I think the question of the coalition of the willing was smaller groups of the most states. I want to also revisit that later because it was also one of the topics we discussed but we are zooming into this question of the EU economic model because I think all three of you touched upon it.
 In New Daniela said that at Paris, in New York, we need more financial integration. There is mismatch between where industrial policy is made and where the fiscal resources come. Perhaps a question to all three of you.
 So step between these journeys of capacity and drop in the US demand of terrorists, what would be the key measures that we need beyond those that you have mentioned and can Germany and France pay well in advancing them?
 I think we all three may want to comment. So we have to look at the short and the medium and long term. In the short term, I think the term industrial policy is the right one because we need to make sure that those industries which are strategic for Europe to have can survive in Europe.
 I'm deliberately choosing that word because the pressure is so high that we risk losing core industry to other world regions and bringing that back will be very, very hard.
 We've seen it with the solar industry now if wind leaves as well, we are very weak on renewables which we are anyways.
 The chemical industry has huge problems not to even speak of the car industry and the whole value chain behind the car producers.
 So I think there is a real moment of devising smart ways to support in the short term.
 But in the medium term or for the medium term, we also need to take measures very quickly that allow new entrepreneurs to actually come into the market and build their business.
 So in Europe we are not doing bad on patents, we are not doing bad on research and development, but translating research if it is done in a university context into marketable products is very difficult.
 So that means we have to now start building partnerships between research units, universities and the private sector to enable them to think even of going into the economic sector with a startup or joining a larger existing corporate with an idea.
 That's one thing, the other thing is of course financing in that context and that is the problem we all know, startups usually are able to fund themselves for the first, maybe the second round when they need to raise money, but then the third or fourth when volumes get bigger and they need money faster because they have a momentum for growth.
 Then they decide to go very often to the US and settle at the West Coast.
 Behind that lies a very big question of how we think about our financial markets, how we create the conditions that private capital is more mobile and can actually be invested in more risky endeavors because we need to invest into risky endeavors in order to create economic growth and innovation.
 So here Europe clearly lacks behind and this is not just a question of passing a European law, it is about rethinking the way we have designed our pension systems, for instance, where in a country like Germany billions of euros are stuck in investments which are really stable and safe, but do not contribute to economic growth and innovation.
 So I think I'll leave it there because the others will also have important things to say, but I think really we need to take immediate action which are in a way more supportive, if not even protective because we are facing unequal market conditions and not a level playing field, but then we need to act as quickly to create a new context which will only be there in the medium term so we can revive the economic fabric of the European Union in a very entrepreneurial way.
 With much less of the state than we currently have.
 Shahin, would you like to add anything? No, I think we're suffering a bit in Europe from an intellectual consensus that made industrial policy a bad word and there was a good reason for that is that when the single market was formed, it was formed on the ashes of national industrial policies that were indeed an obstacle to the integration of the single market.
 I think that mentality today that industrial policy means necessarily a weakening of the single market is something that we have to do away with because it doesn't have to be the case.
 And I think this intellectual obstacle is really important to overcome. I don't think it has been overcome yet.
 There has been a very interesting non paper at the initiative of the BMVA inside the German coalition that I think for the first time has accepted the notion of European preference, which I think is kind of a very important contribution to the debate.
 We're having in the EU will be having about industrial policy, but interestingly enough, that acceptance is a very narrow acceptance only for the auto sector when you could argue that actually it should apply and I think this is the French you to a large extent to a much too much broader set of sectors.
 Indeed, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that we would only apply this by European preference to the auto sector and not to batteries, for instance, because in fact, you know, really an electric vehicle is mostly a battery on wheels more than anything else.
 So I think we have to think a bit more broadly with the upstream and downstream supply chains. I'm still struck today that we don't have a European approach to battery, for instance, and that is creating a very interesting and very profound breakdowns in the single market.
 For instance, if you look at five different battery plans in Sweden, Germany, France, Poland, while you will observe is that they each have very different levels of constraints on the FDI investor in most cases China sometimes Korea.
 Very different levels of environmental protection, very different levels of social workers protection, very different levels of clean energy input and very different levels of government subsidies.
 The Hungarian case stands at one extreme with the highest level of subsidy and the lowest level of environmental protection. The Swedish example stands out as, you know, the highest environmental standards 100% clean energy 100% domestic production and the lowest level of public subsidy.
 So guess what happened Sweden, the North Pole factory failed and it failed why? Because BMW cancelled a $2 billion order for North Pole batteries and placed the order instead with the Hungarian maker.
 We basically have a policy that has destroyed the single market and that has created a cannibalization between different battery plans in Europe. If we had had a European industrial policy, all of these plans would have survived with a fairly even amount of environmental protection, a fairly amount of investor protection also for foreign investors in these joint ventures.
 So I think we need to really accelerate that change of thinking. I'm encouraged that the EU, the Commission is moving in that direction. I'm, as I said earlier, worried that, you know, the transition in Member States minus not is not, is not fast enough.
 Thank you. Do you know what you like to comment on this? I mean, very quickly because I completely agree with what was said. I think private capital is key. I mean, if you look at defense startups in Europe, 50% of investment comes from the United States.
 And this is when we are in the middle of a debate on should we buy more European should we focus on European production in or you know, it's just it's insane to me that we are when we talk about this to date, we're not doing it holistically like Daniel has pointed out or she has pointed out.
 I think the internal barriers to the single market was showing us, it's been perfectly the battery example is another thing that we need to address quickly and actually when you ask industry, what's the problem with that they don't really talk about I mean simplification yes they'd like some, they'd like less paperwork. Yeah, that's that's clear.
 But actually it would be much easier if they knew that doing business in Poland is exactly the same as doing business in France and then and sometimes you have country even within a country it's different according to the region. So I think there's there's real things that we can do around that real things about unlocking investment in European investment and making sure that European investment stays in Europe because that's the other thing is that if you look at pension funds.
 And some of them invest in the US because they think actually love money will go further you know so there's there are practical things that we can do.
 And then I think in terms of inbound and outbound but especially inbound investment screening is is really key so there is over the last two years I think there's been a real reckoning of.
 China but not only China coming in investing becoming majority shareholder taking over critical industries and all of this happening and then realizing oh my goodness we've lost something we've not only lost job creation and and and a vital industry for European competitiveness we're also we've lost the race because we because they've you know absorbed the intellectual property the research and their and their private broad so there is a lot again in that economic security.
 Strategy on how you address that and how you don't basically don't prevent investment from coming from a from abroad but you do it in a way that contributes to a competitiveness and I think that's the third kind of pillar to the tripod of investment caps investment of reducing internal barriers to the single market and making sure that for a direct investment is used in the best possible way for for Europe.
 Thank you Georgina I want to switch topics a bit but staying with you she said that a lot of the things that happened this year and over the summer could be explained by Europe's dependence on the US when it comes to security and defense and one questions of course with the shift in the transatlantic relationship I will call shift.
 How can Europe ramp up its defense capacity without the US and without creating a deterrence gap during this transition so how can we do both simultaneously ramp up our defense ambitions but not run into into a lack of deterrence.
 I think the French are happy in that sorry did you want to jump in share you know go ahead I'll follow.
 So I think the French are happy with the view that now we are talking about a move to a European led security order right that's pretty evident because the United States has signaled for years but has made it particularly acute in the last with the publication of national security strategy although the people I speak to in Washington say you shouldn't just read that you should read the triptych right.
 There's going to be a national defense review and then there's going to be a force posture review and you've got to look at all three to understand the extent to which the US will be withdrawing troops and at what length etc but point being in Europe everyone has accepted that we need to move to European led security order.
 I think ideally it would be a 70 30 bird and shift so you have Europeans leading on the political leadership that also means Washington accepting to take a step back which has not always been easy because sometimes they say they want Europeans to do more in them and they're like oh no actually we really want to be part of that decision making.
 It also means taking on much more responsibility for conventional defense but then also reducing your asks I think ask little of the United States and do more is the perfect recipe to maintain interest and some form of presence of the US on the continent and you know the US's responsibilities could be of course the nuclear deterrent and then some some capabilities that we simply cannot replace in the short term and those are all sorts of things about you know
 in surveillance for conscience and a number of precise strict precision capabilities but you can you can actually create a list that's pretty sure if you can show that you're doing your meeting your defense commitments you are increasing defense spending and you are genuine about taking on more responsibility for your defense on the defense procurements and like the defense industry said that's much more complicated
 because actually we need arms right now and we can our industry say we can't produce like we are producing but we can't meet full delivery so I think that you have to accept that we're going to need to purchase from abroad at least in the short term and then also there are increasing dependency so even the US defense industry defense industry with European defense industry
 we depend on critical raw materials coming back coming in from China like it's not like a simple saying we simply need to put more money on the table we simply need to secure better supply chains and all be okay same in terms of investment a lot of the investment in our defense sector comes from the United States
 and the US remains an important market for some of our biggest defense companies like Ryan Mitchell has made it explicit that it wants to continue benefiting from the US so I think more realism on those interdependencies and a more strategic and clear view clear right view where those dependencies exist
 and I have a short medium long term plan to face those out would be much more helpful than being locked into an endless debate about simply prioritizing European versus prioritizing European and the rest of the world
 You Shahin, you wanted to come in before? Yes, I think I have a more alarmist view of the situation we've been effectively dealing with the war on European soil for more than almost three years now almost four actually
 and I think the record of what we have done to gear up and put our defense industrial sector into a war economy mode is appalling
 and I think France and Germany have a particular responsibility the two countries that agreed actually before the war to very important defense cooperation project one in building a new generation tank
 and the other in building a new generation fighter jet program nobody wants to say it loudly and publicly but the reality is that both of these projects are dying
 they will not be a tank coming out of this project before there is one coming out from the factories of Hanmeetal so I think that cooperation project has effectively lost its purpose and there are such tensions between France and Germany on the fighter jet program that is very likely that before the end of the year
 the chancellor will announce to withdraw all of Germany from the program I mean doing that in the middle of an historical conflict I think is a pretty damning outcome
 I agree however with what Georgina has said that I think we have tended potentially in France to simplify the issue as just the need to have European funding for defense capacity and I don't think it's as simple as that
 I think we need European defense funding and I think we have a number of that with safe we will definitely need more of it we have a number of that with the current plan to build a reparation loan to Ukraine but I think we will need more of that
 but beyond having a common European funding we will need an agreement on what is it that we want to do with this common European funding and I think I agree with what was said earlier that we need to identify a short list of priorities that are shared priorities and that we prepare to fund in common that will probably include communication systems that are independent from that of the US
 reconnaissance interreliant systems that are independent from that of the US precision strike and long range strike capacity air defense and maybe a drone force you know I think you can agree on a list of four or five things that you know or a shared priority in that we should put common funding towards
 but once you've done that you will need a European procurement system to deliver on that because that cannot be procured on a purely national basis and that will be a big change both in France and in Germany which where there is an historical tendency for you know national defense spending to be a way of driving spending towards national defense champions
 in order to do that have a European procurement you probably also need to have some level of Europeanization of the supply side so basically the Europeanization of the industrial base either by way of national champions like a hand metal becoming a European champion which I think it's well on its way to become one or kind of a state led enterprise like Airbus basically pulling together a different national champions to turn them into a European champion
 we've done it with Airbus a while ago there's no reason we shouldn't be able to do it with defense I think once we have that so the unification of demand by a European procurement program and the unification of supply
 we will need to have potentially discussions around arms export control you know if we have created weapons in common do we decide in common who do we export them to this today is viewed as a very important national prerogative I think that will need to become a European one
 and last and potentially not least when we have all of this nice defense equipment we probably need to decide in common how and when we want to use it and so that's basically a stepping stone into a discussion around moving you know common security and defense policy from a you know unanimous voting domain to potentially qualified majority domain so I'm just listing these items to illustrate that building a true European defense and security is a very important thing
 European defense and security architecture is actually a project that is immensely political over and above finding the common funding for it and I don't think we have had a serious enough conversation about that in part because many countries and I would probably put Germany as one of them wants to believe that we are just living a short nightmare from which we are going to wake up and when we wake up we will have you know a return to the good all transatlantic alliance
 and we don't need to think so hard about building a European alternative I think we know we're not going to wake up from that nightmare and return to the good status quo on tape that status quo on tape I think has disappeared I had the impression after the Munich security conference speech by JD Vance that there had been a real awakening in Berlin and that there was a true and profound realization that we needed to forget the dreams of returning to the status quo on tape
 and I have the impression that also that speech is now viewed as a short nightmare that we may be able to wake up from I think if anything I hope the national security strategy that we saw last week is showing that the nightmare is not over and we need to prepare for it
 and you know our dependency on the US is not just when it comes to defense but also when it comes to technology and networks and one sentence that stuck with me from the Paris Applied Dialogue last week was that someone said digital sovereignty means no one can accidentally or intentionally turn off our networks and our devices
 and also drawing from the European Digital Sovereignty Summit a few weeks ago what should be the EU parties in this area to become more sovereign in the digital realm?
 Thank you I outright and build a bridge between what Georgina and Shane have just said on defense and about the question of of tech and digital sovereignty
 because I think we are we are risking to face the very same situation that there is a high awareness now of risk and Shane I would say since man's and the NSS there is a very strong and and and thorough understanding that we have enormous dependencies on the US and on China and other ways and we need to get out of that in a very carefully managed way and yet it doesn't work
 and why doesn't it not work because we need a systemic answer it doesn't work by just building another industrial project or by just I'm finding a solution for a particular problem but as Shane has laid out and starts with a question where do we raise the money?
 How do we define the priorities to to spend the money? How do we then decide to deliver us because all those questions are of course on the top level European questions but they have repercussions for every single member state and hence domestic constituencies
 but unless we manage to build up that system I do not think that we will make that leap forward which we need to make because every euro spent now has to be spent in the most efficient way and we are currently not doing that
 and the same is true for the tech and digital agenda here again we see dynamics we see a very clear risk assessment we now know that 80% of our digital procurement be it hardware or software comes from outside of the EU
 with the US and China being the major providers we want to catch up but at the same time it's not only about catching up but it's also leapfroding towards the next technology
 what we have seen so far is that countries who have the fiscal space or who created like France decide to invest in their own national catch up process both in terms of public money and then trying to mobilize private money alongside those flows
 and that will definitely lead to sub optimal results because again just like in defense there are economies of scale to be had there is a scalability of solutions is very very relevant
 the access to data can't be done by many small companies at the same time you need to pool you need to really go big on many issues
 and unless Europe manages a systemic response this won't happen because national interests will always play such a strong role that unless you have a real European logic
 and just like Shaina also think in the tech sector that begins with joined European public investment and then a framework to draw more private investment into promising projects
 I think that's what we need so right now we see efforts in January from so stood the first AI summit now there was a Franco German initiative for European digital sovereignty summit in Berlin
 and just after that another French summit on an AI adoption which became very practical and that is very good
 but those are just first steps we really need a systematic response which can get Europe as a whole over the very understandable but still short term interest that national governments bring to the table
 Thank you Danila just a very quick reminder to audience that you can ask your questions in the F&A it's called because it's German, Frankfurt, Box in Zoom
 maybe perhaps moving a bit away from these sectoral questions and looking ahead and on the more political circumstances
 so the challenges in the different sectors are very similar as you laid out Danila and Angelhin and Socio Gino we need to raise money we need to decide we need to have a very systematic approach to the challenges at the same time
 of course the problems are not just external we have a rising polarization within the EU we have Eurosceptic actors that are on the surge
 and we have the French presidential elections in 2027 looming with also of course rise up the AfD in Germany so also in France and Germany very instable domestic political circumstances
 can we or how can the EU stay cohesive and actually take action on all of these areas that you have lined out with the difficult domestic instances that we have and I just only laid out the situation in the Member States we of course also have the rather instable you can parliament at this moment in time
 how dire is on the political front in France, Germany and the EU and your view and Danila already have you on my screen perhaps you would like to start
 I think the situation is very serious because we have rising far right support in key countries if you look at Germany we have the in some opinion polls outgrowing the Christian Democrats and then if you look at the regional level and we have a number of regional elections coming up they may actually not only go first but in some cases
 there is potential to that they gain an absolute majority if that happens there will be strengthening of part in Germany of AfD but in other countries as well of parties who take very critical
 there are chances on European cooperation and European further European integration or even want to deconstruct part of the achievement and I think we have to go into a very very serious debate in two ways one is what is the price of deconstructing Europe just now where we actually have external forces who announce including the National Security Strategy of the United States
 who announce that they are interested to work with players who want to weaken Europe as a political union or politically unified entity
 if that is not enough to know I ask myself what else we need in terms of signaling to understand that we have a serious not only economic and security situation but also a serious political situation
 what needs to be done so first of all let's all face the price of non-Europe in particular these times let's look very seriously at the alternative models that are being presented
 because there is now a systemic conflict clearly there with Europe holding on to Western mostly liberal democratic models rule of law some integration and the creation of a space where conflicts are definitely played out in peaceful terms where you have a legal framework that enables moderation between competing interests where there's political decision making
 on a super national level all this is a huge achievement for a continent that has gone through so many wars and if that breaks up or gets more paralyzed than it is at the moment
 Europe will will simply not be able to face the global challenges that are out there
 so I think that that discussion of that price is important and then we need to discuss well how can we get better and effective and sustain what we have
 but of course we also need to think very seriously about what are the reasons that citizens are so willing to cast votes or at least to say in opinion polls that they want to vote for parties which go beyond the consensus that has carried the European project and the democratic project in Europe for so many decades
 we need to understand the grievances and then on a positive level I think political leaders who face a very difficult times but you know fragmented parliament's tensions within parliamentary groups tensions within parties external interference a difficult
 to even access citizens in a sphere of disinformation with what they think they want to communicate so all this is complicating the democratic process but what is also lacking is a very clear vision where policy makers want to take the EU the economic model the society model
 and after all also the political model so we are defending something but we don't have a clear-cut future vision how this can be good and even better than it is today and I believe there are so many positive things to say about Europe and so many visions that could be developed if we took the time to do it
 so my argument will be at this point let's look at all the problems taken very seriously understand what citizens grievances are and how they can be drawn into the political process to give them a voice but at the same time be very clear we have to strengthen our unity if we want to protect the European way of life
 and last time I checked the Russian or the Chinese one didn't seem particularly attractive to many Europeans
 Shaheen and Georgina one of the big blooming questions in all debates is of course what will happen to the European project and all of the European solutions that we need if there is a Badela or Le Pen president coming in 2027
 so from a French perspective what will it mean perhaps you want to start Shaheen what will you do?
 I'll try to answer one in passing so I think it would be a real shock maybe but I think even before it arrives I think it's already playing a role in both the Franco-Derman dynamic but also in the European dynamic more broadly
 I think all of these issues that we've stressed the need for defense integration, for fiscal integration, the all the discussions around the EU budget are probably held hostage by the fact that there is a profound political uncertainty about what will happen in France
 and I can be honest I think that uncertainty has increased even more in recent weeks and months or since the snap elections called by President Macron
 it was pretty clear on the whole for a long time that there was basically almost no candidate on the center left that could win against Le Pen or Badela as per the polls
 but one could have been reassured by the fact that most candidates on the center right had a decent shot
 and in particular Idwafilip who I think was the leading candidate on the center right was up until the summer not guaranteed but had a strong chance of winning
 I think there's been a very important change in the polls since the fall essentially since the autumn
 which is that even Idwafilip who is kind of the leading candidate on the right is now losing in the second round versus Slepen or Badela
 there is also an interesting dynamic which is that Badela and Le Pen who were polling at about the same level
 we now have a slight lead for Badela so Badela could be actually a better candidate than Le Pen which is somewhat surprising
 so I think there is a high degree of uncertainty about the political outcome but I think there is now less and less visibility about who is an alternative to the far right
 the second point quickly is that I think there is some hope in many parts of Europe that Le Pen or Badela victory would result in the similar political outcome that we are seeing in Italy
 so I'm asked very often whether in fact Le Pen is going to be just another meloni
 and I think there are two reasons why this is not necessarily going to be the case
 first I mean I think it's true to say that the RN has normalized a lot so it's no longer arguing for leaving the EU
 no longer arguing for leaving the EU no longer arguing for bringing back the pension age to 60 years old
 so I think there are meaningful changes and meaningful repositioning
 that being said I think there are two reasons why the relationship between France and the EU and France and Germany will be different than what it has been under meloni and Italy
 one is I think this is a bit counterintuitive I think France has weaker institutions than Italy and weaker checks and balances
 effectively meloni is forced to deal with a parliament it's a true parliamentary democracy it's forced to deal with a presidency that is a counterweight and forced to deal with the EU
 and also with regional politics because there are important regional governments at play
 so that's the one thing that is different the second and maybe the most important thing is that Italy needed and was about to receive a most 300 billion of EU funds when meloni arrived in government
 and therefore she had a very strong incentive to behave in a pro-European way in order to receive this funds
 France on the contrary will be a net contributor and actually the first fight between the next R&N government if there was to be one in the EU would be on the EU budget
 where France is likely to be facing a real need for fiscal consolidation at a time where potentially its contribution to the EU budget would have to increase
 I think that's going to be a point of friction but I think France also has weaker checks and balances than Italy it's a fully presidential system where the president essentially has all powers
 it doesn't have a strong tradition of parliamentary checks and balances and so as a result we are going to not experience a lot of checks and balances from part of it
 but to me is the reason why we cannot be fully reassured that a Le Pen/Bar de la Presidency would be as smooth as what we've experienced with Italy for the time being
 Georgina let me throw in one final question for you also on this French presidential issue I think when it comes to a possible French-Fouright president but more generally speaking for governments in EU there are two lines of thoughts on different integration
 one is we should do as much as possible in smaller groups to not be tied down by governments that don't want to move with us the other one is we should actually do as much as we can in the Super National European setting to limit the options of those governments to break out
 because it of course sets different constraints than intergovernmental pathways
 so looking also towards the what Shaheen has said and the outlook in France perhaps you can tie into your assessment also this question how do we go forward when it comes to
 coalitions of the willing or smaller groups of the mistakes in the EU which you have already mentioned as a solution
 thank you can I just say I completely agree with what Shaheen has just said on what a ensemble of them are less in the lead presidency would look like and I think the importance of clarifying that being a French president versus the Italian Prime Minister is different in terms of leverage and power
 the question mark I have really is Miloni surrounded herself all her EU advisors were the cremder like cremder of diplomats in the Italian system who knew the EU inside out right her European advisors very good the person she appointed as Italian permanent representative in Brussels has long dealt with the EU so she she also desired she sort of realized that the EU is perhaps one of her weaker points of understanding
 and surrounded herself by by people who really understood how to work the EU it's not clear to me that the rassum remuneration that would have the same approach at all but what I do here is you know as badelais a very convincing politician like he's you know he's brought out a book which is many French people French watches know that's like your first step into real credibility and so he's brought out I think it's as even a second book about his sort of vision for France
 and when you sort of listen off hand but not really concentrating on what he says he says things about industrial policy which are quite interesting he says things about energy policy and more and more businesses are actually listening to what he has to say and I think there is a willingness from the has on the matter so now to reach out to the business world to be on their vote based to kind of understand some of the
 the sort of constraints that they are facing so I don't know how what team they would have around them I think matters a little bit as well even though as Shane said the president has of course a lot of of leeway on your on your point about how do we deal with the far right I mean I
 really think that coalitions of groups of members is inevitable and I think partly because you might not be able to implement go ahead just as a group of members is without having a vulnerable but you can certainly shake the discussion and at the moment if you think of 2017 Macon the EU has never felt so French in many ways whether it's on defense on industrial policy but yet today in particularly since 2024 the decision
 Parliament France is is very weak in terms of its leadership and what's emanated from that is groups of member states that are really trying to drive the discussion but maybe by themselves because they're not a big member state can't fully lead the strategic discussion at the EU
 level and so you're having little discussions all of them I think that that is the way frankly that we have to go if we're going to respond in some capacity a bit faster because if we just expect to have these conversations that EU level and every European council meeting especially with
 we already I think have 14 centre rights, lash-bar-right governments in the council that that would work could even increase even further and I think we can't afford to wait EU decision levels every single time the decision
 has to happen outside of that at the same time I think there are going discussions and two you've been writing about this about how do we prevent a member state and two members from blocking advancement and I think that is a key decision
 Shaheen has written about as well I think Daniela you've like you know these are genuine discussions that have to happen and what are the red lines where we you know we have to be willing to say
 well you can't we find a mechanism to avoid you blocking it and if you do block it and it's really counter the majority of you interest what's the
 repercussions and consequences of that but I think on the decision shaping which is really what we the problem we have now is that you use much more reactive than it is preventive and that that has to happen in smaller formats
 so really the question what is the price of not having your both citizens and for government this abstract thank you Shaheen and Jajina and Daniela I want to very briefly move to the questions that the audience asked and we try to group them somewhat
 and I think the first two questions are really about leadership and trust so one question is about whether growing by the European Commission has contributed to declining trust in the use of huge national government is there a
 declining trust present in national governments when it comes to the institutions and the other one is about the vacuum of leadership that you have mentioned Georgina and what can what steps can be taken to counter this and is
 made someone who understands the moment and will rise to it so I go first okay thanks so first of all on on opinion poll data and trust that citizens have I don't know any data that relates the spending of the EU to trust in the institutions maybe our colleagues have but what I can say is we see very clearly
 there are no cross country data that citizens trust in institutions and basically to put it more globally for the state or government to deliver is really low and going down in key EU member states including in Germany
 however interestingly this is not immediately translated into questioning of democracy as a system however I still see a risk and a link because if citizens have the feeling the system doesn't work any longer where the state kind of reaches me it fails like whatever infrastructure doesn't work anymore digitalization has worked schools are not good anymore
 all these day-to-day experiences they build up a bad image and that can then lead to to an interpretation also because we now have parties who really polarize against government and elites that basically the trust of citizens is pushed down even further and now for that question of money I think we now have a unique opportunity and I'm speaking for the German case here because
 the government now has created not the government the previous parliament actually created physical space for this government to spend on investment infrastructure for instance and also on defense without necessarily cutting into social policy and other things and this is the momentum I think we have to see by both spending smartly
 implementing some reforms and creating a real new dynamic to show that modernization is possible and that the state can actually deliver and better than it has done before
 so I think there is a link between you know sums of money put on to the table and then how does it at the end look in terms of how valid how how reasonable was that investment but for the European level I unfortunately haven't seen any data so I cannot respond to that
 now for the question of leadership I'll pick that up to because there was a question a German dimension in the question and that is interestingly Friedrich Mals when he got elected on that same evening he went on public TV as they do and in that first big talk show where all the leaders come together with the different parties and he said very clearly that an era has ended that transatlantic relations aren't what they used to be and that Europe has to take things into their hands and that Germany has a role to take.
 Now since then I would not say that there is a lack of general commitment I think the strategic inside is there. However, what we don't see at the moment is an agenda also between Germany and France where for the sake of European progress either government is really willing to compromise on something to get things done and move things forward and Europe only works by compromise.
 So you can never have it all in particular not in a crisis situation which we are currently in and this you know this momentum I think needs to come soon because otherwise I don't think that will be major progress.
 There are many many important compromises to be struck be it on the way or whether we spend money together in the European Union how we set that up what the priorities are how we balance a new relationship between government and the state and the economy.
 Because there again France and Germany traditionally come from quite different positions and it doesn't help to have that competition within the EU necessarily but to really rethink how we shape the European economic framework in a new way including competition policy as was said, including deepening the financial market.
 So all these things we see bits and pieces that the discussion is happening between Paris and Berlin but I have not seen traces of a compromise package that is encompassing and really allows a leap forward quite yet.
 Perhaps the next question for you Georgina you can of course also respond to you to the leadership question but the next one is how much damage has the exclusion of the UK from safe to European defense ambitions and general how do you see the future of the UK was required to Europe.
 The self exclusion.
 Thank you for the ride. How bad is it that UK the UK still hasn't been admitted to say materially honestly it doesn't I think make a huge difference like the UK if it hasn't the EU hasn't accepted the EU can still industry can still take part from I think up to 30% it wouldn't be as high in terms of bidding for EU money and contracts but you can still participate and UK defense industry is still active in the EU.
 But I think politically it sends a very bad signal for two reasons first the reset the British I mean the Labour government is very different to the previous like Tory governments.
 I think part of the problem is that they think that because their Labour they'll get a bit they'll get an easier ride inside the EU and that's not obviously not that's misunderstanding the EU but nonetheless you know they they receive this kind of answer and
 the minister in charge said look this will not hold back the reset we're still very serious about it but but of course behind closed doors there's extreme disappointment and there's a sense that we are really trying to reset this is really important it was send a political signal and yet the EU blocks us out of it and actually doesn't really give us that has actually answer to our questions which is why is the price tag because that seems to be the biggest issue that the EU wants the UK to contribute large amounts of money.
 And when the UK said can you give me a breakdown of that number the EU is basically founded and not be been able to give an account and so they behind I think behind closed doors there is a sense that this does actually not damage the reset but it certainly is a it's a you know it's not a great day for the reset so I think politically that matters and I think also geopolitically if we're talking about Europe doing more for its security and defense what signal we sending.
 That actually we can't in a way negotiate a European country of course non EU but European country participation in a new EU defense program I just don't think it's great I again I don't know if the US and Russia really following that closely the negotiations of the UK as is to save but nonetheless I think the political signaling matters of course I understand that there are multiple reasons why the EU is responding the way that it has you know the UK simply not a priority.
 London forgets this but like in the long list of when is the UK really come up in conversation so far in the hour that we've had very little there are lots of other things going on.
 I think the EU is afraid of being locked into an agreement with the UK that could have a very different leadership in a few years time.
 I think the UK the EU is also expecting the UK to fully implement the existing deals and it hasn't done that so there's a sense of you know you need to deliver first and then we can we can see what more we can like more more bubbles we can put to the Christmas tree and then I think the power vacuum is is obviously a problem because.
 France for example is really not paying much attention to this and but they are the major blocker I think one of the major blockers to UK accessing safe and I think that's also because there's a breakdown a little bit of a breakdown in command between Paris and Brussels and it's much more difficult to compromise when you are focused on on other things and I think that political vacuum is not helping either.
 But I think the fall back of this is the way that you use always done things and we don't were scared of offering something to a third country that might others might ask I mean if you're negotiating a safer green with the Canada you really should be able to negotiate one with the UK and so as much as I've been throughout the Brexit negotiations quite hard on the UK's negotiating position and often thought the UK thought it would get a better deal because it's a security guarantor etc.
 I think in this case the EU if it really is to oppose the UK's participation has to have a much clearer answer as to why it is opposing it is it really that it's afraid to be locked into something in which case coming not have a break clause in the agreement those exist if it's a numbers thing then I think the EU has to be better explaining then why the number is as high as it's proposing.
 So in the next question is for you on the future of the next generation by pen systems I think this is a relation as possible German policy changes from mentioned how does he assess then how do you assess that the future of this project from both the German and the French perspective.
 So I didn't hear which project next generation by pen system.
 Ah okay.
 I mean I think it's hard to say but to me there is no future for neither the FKAS nor the main background system I think both or in fact projects that you know we cannot see officially but I think in effect in abandoned.
 I think that doesn't mean that there's no space for Franco German defense cooperation I think there is an enormous amount of space in some in areas that have been opened by Germany and I'm thinking about the European sky shield which I think warringly has been decided to be based on almost entirely non European technology I think you know building a European and the genius air defense system.
 You know that is entirely dominated by us and Israeli technology is I think a bit problematic I think there is an area of cooperation there and there is importantly an area of cooperation that's been identified both by the chancellor and by the president in which since the election we haven't seen a lot of progress on which is the question of nuclear deterrence.
 Actually they have been conducted a poll over the last year over Germans attitudes towards nuclear deterrence and it's very striking to see a very profound and rapid evolution whereby basically Germans are now you know at 80% favourable to a joint Franco German nuclear deterrence umbrella.
 So I think that's a very important shift which I hope the French and the German governments can work on potentially also with the British government and that might be an area where where a reset is more likely maybe a quick reaction to Georgina I think you know things work the other way around the British government proposed a number of participating in the same project in the hundreds of millions of euros.
 When you know by any measure you know you would at least be you know an order of magnitude higher whether you go by the size of the defense industry of the UK the size of defense spending or the size of GDP whichever measure you want to take.
 And maybe the EU didn't have a good way of explaining its five plus billion contribution demand but you know in any event we would not be you know in the hundreds of millions that the British government was proposing maybe a last word even though I saw that the person asking the question has left the chat.
 The question was asked about how I think the term used was reckless borrowing by the European Commission had undermined confidence in the EU institutions and I think both are actually factually inaccurate there is no such thing as reckless borrowing by the European Commission there has been large borrowing by the European Commission as part of the NGU program.
 I think most people would agree today to say that the assessment of that borrowing has been extraordinarily effective at dealing with the fallout of the Covid crisis both in terms of public health as well as in terms of macro economic consequences so I don't think anybody would use the word reckless to qualify this amount of borrowing and second actually there is some data about confidence in EU institutions and European Commission and.
 There is actually a long history of that data with the euro barometer there hasn't been a meaningful decline of confidence in EU institutions since that borrowing so I think that you know that's a way of putting this issue to rest it's wrong to say that EU borrowing is undermining confidence in EU institutions in fact there's been no decline in confidence in EU institutions there's been some decline however in confidence in national governments but in fact the difference between confidence in EU.
 The difference between confidence in EU government and national government is actually increasingly striking historically saw the European countries had little confidence in their national governments and high confidence in European governments and it was the reverse in Northern Europe and in particular in Germany and I think what's interesting is that now you have a decline in confidence in national governments including in Germany but you still have quite a high level of confidence in European government.
 Let me do one very fine round of final statements tying it to two of the questions that we have and it's really are we just going through a difficult time and it will end when the EU is capable of defending itself and what will it take for national leads in France and Germany to accept that separate national economic military and digital strategies are simply insufficient to counter the disruptions by current leaders of the US a Russia and China.
 And I would ask you to just maybe make a very brief final comment relying on or sort of relating to these questions and then we will come to an end.
 Shaheen, would you like to start?
 Yes, so I think Europe is used to go through these crises that each time appear existential and I think each time it is proving that it can respond to them it is sadly always responding to them a bit too slowly and a bit imperfectly but I think it tend to come out stronger from each of these shocks and crises and I think this time will be no different.
 I would highlight one thing with and I don't want to sound complacent but I think there's one important change about Europe politics over the last decade is that even though we have very serious external threats I'm thinking about Russia but I'm also thinking about the way the US is perceiving now the EU was an hostile continent or rather the way the US is turning into an hostile continent towards the EU.
 But domestically we have these fears about the IFD in Germany, about the RN in France but what has happened over the last decade is that none of these parties are now truly anti-European parties in the sense that they have as a political project the destruction of the EU.
 They have all become anti-immigration party and defense of a certain view of white and Christian Europe but they no longer really fight for the demise of the EU in fact they believe that they can further the agenda by way of the EU.
 I think that changes a lot the sort of threats from within that Europe was living through over the last decade.
 A decade ago the IFD was a party that wanted to break the Euro down.
 A decade ago the RN wanted to leave the EU as well as the EU. I think all of that has gone out the window and now we're dealing with parties that have a political project about Europe that may be different from some of our project but I think it's still in a way a project that requires the EU to sustain itself.
 I think that's in my view a very important political change that makes Europe politically maybe a bit more stable than it would have been a decade ago.
 Daniela? Some finalists?
 Yes so I think for your question are we witnessing a crisis that goes away? We are witnessing a systemic crisis so the whole order question which I laid out in my first comment I think that is really the design task we have.
 So we have to redesign the security order we have to design a new economic and social model that survives in a good way in under new conditions of very rapid technological development very strong systemic global competition and a new wave of protectionism that is or economic states craft that is used against Europe.
 So that is the task. Is that possible? I think it still is however it will take and that was your question what does it take to get people realize how big the task is.
 I think it will take a lot of public pressure but in a positive sense of support and showing that a way forward is possible.
 What we have seen over the past month is that for instance companies when they speak about Europe they become very critical because they are criticizing over regulation and their view or bureaucracy and all of these things that in their day to day work you know gets all their nerves.
 But what we need is a real realization that Europe is a value to the way we have designed our economy to the way we have designed and developed our democracy and the way we need to redefine security.
 So we have to be careful we must be able to criticize the current system because it's no longer working as well as it did without being anti-European and I think that's where now much more voices and much more ideas are needed because policy makers are navigating an environment where pretty often also polarization between member states plays a role where they have to defend themselves for instance for putting money on the table for European cause or these things are picked up.
 And so I believe we have to counterbalance that by a very constructive push for future debate on the EU.
 So Gina you have the last word.
 Thank you.
 I'm just basically picking up on what she and Daniela have just said the EU has been able to get through multiple crises, Brexit, COVID every time people like you will never get through it it did.
 But I think as Daniela said it is systemic and so it's going to last a while longer than many people would hope.
 I think there are two things that we need to get right and we talked about in this discussion obviously the defense side we just need to be more capable security actors and we need to be able to basically police what's going on in our backyard without always relying heavily on the United States.
 And the second is we need to get our economy in order and we need to be much more competitive because one thing that really strikes me in conversations with the US and I'm not saying we should take what Americans think of Europe as you know as our guiding light but when you're in Washington there is a bipartisan view on three things right.
 The first is of course Europe is to dependent on US security guarantees that annoys them second is that Europeans sap up all their time and this is Democrats saying it as much as Republicans like the every European ambassador that they see comes with a long list of things that they want done.
 It's just not sustainable.
 So we're going with we want these all things we're doing will have one thing that was going from you so I think that the frustration level is really real and the third is a growing number of Americans just think that we're economically stagnating and not interesting and they're in Asian countries as well that think that we're just you know how many times have we heard a beautiful
 world continent with museums and nice handbags and that's about it and I think we need to be much get much more serious about how we unlock investment all the things that we've discussed today and I think that would put us in a much better place.
 Finally on the politics internal politics.
 The EU is really setting a lot of the terms of the debate on the EU and so when Daniel earlier said we also need to be talking about the virtues of the EU what we get out of the EU what would Europe look like without the EU I think this is genuinely important and also moving away from letting the far right consistently set the terms of the European debate because until now the linkages between far right parties in Europe has been quite weak.
 But they are growing links and I saw that Jordan Badell and Matt Nigel Farage today now of course the UK is no no longer member of the EU self excluded itself but there are coalitions and partnerships that being built between the far right they they do not agree on anything I think the Marga movement think that the far right in Europe are aligned politically and socially with them I would say socially and ideologically maybe politically certainly not.
 But there's a lot of misconceptions but things are happening and so if you don't support for right then you really need to get much better at selling your vision for the EU so I think that would be a good start.
 Thank you Jordan thank you Jordan and Shahina Daniela for your excellent insights today I think this was quite the world one tour of many topics that you are facing but I think we have also.
 So I'm rather quite a few proposals for solutions going forward with perhaps a positive visions for the union being one of the bigger ones so thank you very much for being with us on this very last event of the Paris a place dialogue to all six speakers and of course also the audience in the online room today.
 Thank you to for having us bye.
 Thank you bye bye.
