 Dear Mr. Gandhi, Dear students, faculty, staff and friends of the HATISchool, Ladies and Gentlemen,
 it is my great honor to welcome Mr. Rohl Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 to the HATISchool this afternoon for an exchange with our students.
 To the Indians in the room, I actually suspect to everybody in the room, Mr. Gandhi needs no introduction.
 He's been a prominent voice in India's democratic and political life for over two decades and stands,
 like few others, for secular and democratic India focused on social welfare and inclusive development.
 Rohl Gandhi was first elected to Lok Sabha in 2004 and has served in multiple terms as member of Parliament
 for the Indian National Congress representing constituencies in Odapradesh.
 He has held prominent roles within his party, including General Secretary, Vice President and President
 of the Indian National Congress, contributing significantly to its organizational and ideological direction.
 He currently serves as the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, where he plays a vital role in parliamentary debates and democratic accountability.
 Throughout his public service, he has consistently emphasized social justice, economic inclusion and the strengthening of democratic institutions,
 in India that is true to its constitution. This may not come as a surprise given your family history,
 but it is worth mentioning in current times where politicians are tempted to redesign political institutions for their own benefit.
 Trained in different institutions in the United States and at the University of Cambridge,
 Rohl Gandhi has worked in the private sector in India and the United Kingdom before entering politics.
 Now India, we know, is a big and diverse country and few can claim to know all parts of it well.
 Yet I would venture to say that you are one of them because you have literally walked across the country by foot,
 south to north and east to west, in two unite India marches between 2022 and 2024.
 When you started the first march on the 7th of September 2022, I suspect you believed that you would not see through to the end,
 but you walked 3,570 kilometers through 12 states speaking with thousands of people along the route over a five-month period.
 And since you then gained some practice and you had your walking shoes on, you achieved twice that distance in half of the time,
 6,700 kilometers from January to just March 2024, visiting over 15 states during the second Barad-Yorayatra.
 They are very eager to hear your insights from this unprecedented effort to connect with citizens at the grassroots level.
 As a university that focuses on good governance, at the Hathi School we strongly believe in the power of ideas grounded in practice and shared through conversation.
 Our graduate programs aim to create an environment of learning where theory and practice meet and where we cross boundaries between disciplines and countries.
 With a student in alumni body representing more than 80 countries, we strive to foster a community in which everybody's insights contribute to the classroom and the broader university experience.
 The Hathi School is proud to have a vibrant Indian community. Can I hear them?
 And a strong network of Indian partners developed under the leadership of our managing director Axel Weisch since 2018.
 Let me see this opportunity to thank both Axel Weisch and our India representative, Nithya Sik, for all their work.
 Our Indian student communities integrate a part of our programs and today we count approximately 250 Indian students in alumni.
 One of these alumni is Ahyud Chankar of our Executive Master of Public Affairs, 2022 cohort, deserves a special thank you.
 Together with his classmates, Jogo Silima and Mihai Joka, he founded the Startup Cities Together and was instrumental in making the connection with Raul Gandhi and his team that allowed us to program today's event.
 Let me also thank Michelle Patrick, who I've just seen, for all her support for today.
 In the spirit of connecting and learning and of recognizing that listening is a form of leadership in a political world where the greatest threats are growing divisions, please join me in giving a warm round of applause to our distinguished guest speaker, Mr. Raul Gandhi.
 Dr. Cornelia Wall, Dr. Axel Weisch and students in faculty.
 Thank you for having me here. It's honor to come here and talk to you.
 I'm going to speak for about five, seven minutes just to lay the foundations and then we'll carry on with question and answers.
 I think we're in the middle of a transition, a social economic political transition transition that is taking place.
 At least in India, we benefited greatly from the hegemony of the United States. From the 1990s till about 2010, 2014, we had tremendous advantages because America was the lone superpower.
 We built a relationship with them, we built a partnership with them. And whether it's Europe or it was us, we lived in a unipolar world where sure America had its shortcomings, America made its mistakes, but America defined the rules, America defined the structure.
 And for the first time, that hegemony is being challenged and it's being challenged effectively.
 So what we are seeing is a dramatic reduction in American power and the challenge that is coming to America is coming across the spectrum.
 It is coming militarily. You can see it in Ukraine, you can see it in the Middle East. It's coming economically, financially.
 There is a challenge being posed on the US dollar, the financial system. And it's pretty clear that the challenges are not to be wished away.
 At the same time, the United States is struggling internally and almost walking away from its earlier position.
 And that is really where we are sitting right now.
 The superpowers are built on energy transitions. So when you change the way you move, when you change the energy system that you use, that's when superpowers arise.
 If you look at the British, they were essentially a coal and a steam engine superpower. There was a transition to petrol and the internal combustion engine. The Americans dominated that.
 And now we are transitioning to the electric motor, to the battery. And the Chinese are trying to dominate that. In fact, they are dominating that.
 And it was very interesting for me to see. I went to the BMW factory. And I could see that. I could see that BMW as a company was being torn by these two different types of mobility.
 The past of BMW is in the internal combustion engine. Their entire plant is designed for the internal combustion engine. And then they are now trying to reshape themselves to build electric cars, build electric motors, etc.
 And you can see that that is just literally tearing the factory apart. And that is happening in a lot of industries.
 So really, that's the first question. Who is going to succeed in this transition? How are we going to succeed in this transition?
 The second big question, which is hurting our politics, is that the West and to an extent India have handed over production to the Chinese.
 So if you looked at the world in the 40s, 50s, 60s, you found that America dominated production. And then later Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea dominated production. Today China dominates production.
 And what that means is that it is very difficult to give large numbers of people employment. You cannot country like India, country the scale of India, even country like the United States, even country like Germany, cannot give its people employment based on services.
 You have to have a production economy, you have to have manufacturing. And we have handed all that to the Chinese. So the next big question is, in this transition, how do democracies produce?
 China has shown the world that you can produce in a non-democratic environment. We have to prove to the world that actually you can produce in a democratic environment.
 So what are the models that are required? How do you think about production in a democratic environment? And what are the type of partnerships that India, the United States and Europe can create to produce in a democratic environment?
 My view is that it will become very difficult for democracy to sustain itself if we are not able to produce. Because you will simply not be able to give the requisite amount of jobs that you need to create a balanced system.
 So I think huge part of the turbulence that we are seeing in Europe, in India and in the United States, the polarization of the politics is because we are not able to give up people jobs.
 And that's happening because we have basically said, China, you produce for the world.
 Look around you, you will see that pretty much everything that you are using is made in China. And that, at least for a country like India, is a problem.
 We have the capability to produce, we have the population to produce, we have the cost structure to produce. But we have just not done it.
 And so that's really for us the challenge. And for me, any partnership that we build with the United States or we build with Europe has to include the idea of production in a democratic environment.
 So I'll stop there. I look forward to hearing your questions. Thank you.
 Thank you very much for these thoughts on the geoeconomic challenges of our times. We can host questions. I don't have an opening question because I actually suspect there is a lot in the room.
 I see no hands in which case I can fill in questions. But don't be shy. We will maybe collect two to start with your first. So there's a microphone coming around.
 And then I'll move over your second. So first here on the left. Please present yourself. And ask your question.
 Thank you very much, Mr Gandhi. In fact, just before coming to her tea, my last assignment was working with the Congress and it was the Karnataka elections, which the Congress did turn around and emerged victorious.
 Why do you think you've not been able to replicate that in any of the other states? That is the first question. Second question. I would just keep it very short.
 If you come to power, how would you create jobs? It's it's it's it's the thing on every of our minds. So there are.
 I mean, we have been able to replicate it. We've won election in telling Anna we won election in Himalayan Pradesh. We've been raising issues as far as the fairness of elections in India is concerned.
 We have done press conferences where we have clearly shown without shadow of a doubt that we won the Hariyana election.
 That we actually don't feel that the Maharashtra election was fair. There is a full scale assault taking place on the institutional framework of our country.
 Last we asked direct questions to the election commission. I mean, I don't know if you've seen that press conference. Brazilian woman. Brazilian woman is voting in Hariyana. I mean, as is on the voting list 20 to 22 times in Hariyana.
 One woman is voting 200 times and one in one polling booth. And when we're asking these questions to the election commission, we're not getting a response.
 So that's one aspect of it that we we fundamentally believe that there is a problem with the electoral machinery in India.
 Second thing is that there is a wholesale capture of our institutional framework. When you when you look at our intelligence agencies, you look at the CBI, you look at the ED, they've been weaponized.
 Look at the number of cases that the ED and the CBI have against BJP people. You'll find the answer is zero.
 And look at the number of cases they have against people who oppose them and you'll find that pretty much most of them are political cases.
 And so there is a there is a weaponization of the institutional framework. There's a capture of the institutional framework.
 If you're a large businessman and you try to support the congress party, you're threatened, you're the ED, the CBI, these people land up.
 So there is a there is an atmosphere in India where the institutions are not performing the role that they should be performing.
 From our from our perspective, congress perspective, we help build the institutional framework. So we never viewed it as our own institutional framework.
 We viewed it as the institutional framework of the country. That's not all the BJP sees it. The BJP views the institutional framework of India as belonging to them.
 So they use it as a tool for building political power. Look at the just look at the look at the difference between how much money the BJP has and how much the opposition has.
 You see a ratio you know one is to 30. How does that happen? I mean so so there is a there is an attack on the democratic system now.
 So then you say to us so what well as the opposition we have to find ways to counter this is not good enough for us to say oh you know there's a problem in the elections we will deal with it and and we will create a method a system of opposition resistance that will succeed.
 But we're not fighting the BJP you have to understand that we're fighting their capture of the Indian institutional structure.
 And this is not just me speaking I travel around the country this is what everybody says to me. The press conference that we did it was actually information that we got from the ground from people saying listen look this is what has happened.
 So that's that's where it comes that as far as the elections are concerned.
 On the on the question of jobs.
 There is only one way that you can produce jobs at scale for a country like India and that is manufacturing right and what we've done in India and what the BJP has done they've completely disentivized manufacturing.
 When they concentrate power into the hands of you know three or four oligarchs the Ambani's and Adhani's of the world these are not guys who are interested in manufacturing if you look at what they do they're trading companies they're not producing companies right and essentially most of them are selling Chinese product in India.
 So what we would do is we would look at in fact some of the stuff that we're seeing in Germany we would look at how to build up small and medium industry we would look at how to create jobs in agriculture and and jobs in the connection between agriculture and the rest of the economy.
 So we would look at the manufacturing and we would realign our GST for example which today is completely anti producer and pro consumer we would try and realign some of those structures.
 So we would look at something like demonetization right demonetization systematically destroyed our small and medium industry just wipe them out because in fact demonetization was an attack on their cash flow.
 So we would we would look we think there is a place for large business in India and we think there is a place for the Ambani's and the Adhanis but we don't think that they should be the only players there.
 So there are many other players at all different levels and those players should be supported they should be supported financially they should be supported technologically they should be supported by governments and it's not something that hasn't been done before India has been successful in manufacturing in fact when we were in power we were manufacturing was approximately 16 and a half 17% of GDP is today 12.
 So we have had to decline in the last 10 years in our manufacturing ability so that's what we do.
 Let me get the mic back to the front row and let's try to see if we can group so one question per person but to present yourself.
 Thank you. It's on. Okay. Firstly, Mr Gandhi I'd like to thank you for having risen from the ashes shows is absolutely no small feat of resurgence. I'd also like to thank you and the Indian national Congress for being the only thing standing between India and a full blown collapse into a totalitarian regime and in our valiant reality.
 In the existing political measma of this information and eyes and every institution once health sacrosanct absolutely jeopardized and plundered you've chosen to bring a certain truth and a certain basic humane dignity into the fight into the war actually.
 Where does this resilience actually come from? How do you keep walking? How do you keep coming back to this big incredible idea of India that some of us think has been irredeemably lost and how do we who have our own struggles and lives to run.
 Plain active role and support you in this journey of India's rebutt I'm I should worry a sampert I come from this the median state of the man who do which holds the uncontested position of exceeding zero seats to a certain someone who shall not be named.
 Thank you.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 Thank you for your speech and I'm also going to echo something that my other colleagues have shared in your speech you mentioned that democracy is what you want to show that democracy is can produce as much as a China is right now.
 But when you democracy itself is under threat what do you plan to do we saw something happened last year with the India Alliance but I mean there hasn't been as much of a rigor in bringing the left together the political left at least within India what do you plan to do right now how do you plan to encourage new young political leaders.
 You know what's going on actually is a fight between two visions of India and it's not it's not me who's walking or me who's doing it there are millions of people in India who have a completely different vision of India than the government of India then the RSS.
 And this is not a new thing this is not something that has started 10 years ago or 15 years ago there have always been two visions of India there has been in Indian history throughout Indian history the democratic impulse conversations between people decisions through consensus and there has also been the idea of aching right.
 And essentially that's the fight taking place do you do you are you going to be ruled by one person by the whims of one person or are you going to be ruled by a conversation and there are people in both sides of that equation.
 There are many people in India who feel actually we should have a strong leader and nobody should question him and that's it and let's not have all this discussion it's a waste of time and then there are there is the other side that says listen India's actually two complex two diverse speaks too many languages has too many different ideas for one person to decide its future and actually India should be a conversation between its states.
 If you read our constitution it says India is a union of states now you know she's saying that she's a gravity and she's Tamil this is a particular vision of the world it is a different vision then say the vision of the people in the Pradesh she speaks Tamil her history is Tamil her entire
 thought system is fundamentally different than say the people who are the people of the people of the people of Nala land so what we are saying is she should have a voice.
 And we are saying that in fact as many different cultures different ideas should have a voice and we have shown.
 Since 1947 that we can actually do it that we can actually have a conversation it's messy it's not you know it doesn't look neat it's messy it's sort of creates tension sometimes people get irritated sometimes but we've been pretty successful at doing it.
 Now there's a new model which says actually we don't want to have this conversation we're going to decide everything and we know better than what the people of India know and that's where I have a problem because for me India is its people and there is nobody who knows better for what India needs then the people of India.
 You know on the India Alliance thing see you tend to see the Alliance building up when an election comes look at it slightly differently.
 All the parties of the India Alliance do not agree with the basic ideology of the RSS that's the point right and you can ask any of them none of them will tell you that actually we believe in the ideological position of the RSS so we are very much united on that question but we have
 tactical contests that take place and we will continue to have them but you will see that when it comes to the opposition requiring unity and you see it every day in parliament for example we are very united and we will we will contest the BJP on on laws that we disagree with it's a
 deeper battle now then simply elections now we are fighting a battle for an alternate vision of India this is what the BJP is proposing is a is essentially the elimination of the constitution elimination of the idea of equality between states elimination of the idea of equality between
 languages and religions elimination of the idea of the central core of the constitution which is that every individual should have the same value so when you when you when for example we see a BJP leader voting in Uttar Pradesh and then voting again in the Haryana election what the BJP is saying is this guy is worth
 two people or when you have one woman who votes 200 times in a polling booth in Haryana what the BJP is saying is this woman has 200 times the value of a normal Indian that's what that's our problem
 so even when I say when I talk about the attack on the voting system the reason they attack in the voting system is they fundamentally don't believe that every Indian is equal in their mind and I've spoken to them I know them I talk to them in their mind there is no way
 that the same person is the same as an upper caste person they just they cannot even come they can't even compute that right and that's that's to me the real revolution in India in 1947 that we said that actually every language every religion every idea in India is equal
 and if you think about it without you know dissing the Europeans no seriously you know sometimes they come to me and and so they're struggling to build an economic union okay
 we built an economic union and a political union in 1947 and we've run it just fine right so India doesn't Indian people do not appreciate what actually India has achieved to have an economic and political union of 1.4 billion people
 that's you know imagine imagine what is it three Europe's is it it's three Europe's right four Europe's almost now so imagine four Europe's and we've gone and built an economic and political union based on the constitution that's the scale of what India has done and if you're going to have any conversation about democracy on the planet
 you cannot ignore by far the largest and most complex democracy in the world and that's why I say that democracy Indian democracy is actually a global public code it's not just an Indian asset it's a global asset
 you imagine when I'm talking about attack on the Indian democratic system I don't say it but it's actually an attack not just in the Indian democratic system it's an attack on the global democratic system because if you want to remove India as a democracy
 if you want to remove 1.5 billion people from the democratic side that's a huge dent on global democracy so that's why I say that it's very important for Indian people especially to ensure that they protect this really valuable resource
 thank you and I hear there's hope for the European Union so the mic is in the front but we will move all the way to the back afterwards that's two questions in a row maybe three actually because I see that will miss both please present yourself and ask your question
 and what you are saying is very correct my question to you is that your family has been you know we really owe a lot as Indians to your family from Nahru Nairu Ji till your father Mr. Achive Gandhi and I don't say them late because I believe these people they never go they still stay till the human being are with their
 so my question to you is so right now we face a problem of EVM because EVM is eroding away the very fabric of democracy what you said is very correct people are scared to vote because they don't they know that they will not be getting what they are voting so as a leader and a very good human being
 will you be able to completely scrap this EVM and we go back to paper what I mean I mean I've been saying it I think I think most opposition people would agree with you you know on the on the
 you you on the you owe my family no I don't see it like that see I think where we are we just represent the voice of people you know
 whether it's my great grandfather or my grandmother they just represented the voice of people and they because they represented the voice of people they got love and affection from people and they were able to do what they did so
 actually if anything is to be old it is to be old to the people of India not the other way around I mean that's fine that that's that's true but look we cannot a there is a number of people in India who support Mr. Modi and we cannot we cannot get away from that fact
 but we do not a lot of us do not agree with his ideology we do not agree with the vision of India that he has we think that the vision will fail we think that the vision has tremendous problems will create massive tension in India will make Indian people fight with each other so we will fight it
 right and it's a clash between two visions of India thank you tija present yourself and ask one question
 Hi Mr. Gandhi thank you so much for this speech just I want to pivot a little bit away from the democracy questions that we've got until now and I want to go back to your speech you've talked a lot about production and how it's important to give jobs but I wanted to take a step forward and look at the environment of India and the complex of environmental governance we've seen from the Modi government from the Nicobar to the Middle East recently and with the intense amounts of air quality pollution in New Delhi
 what you're seeing adds a humongous amount to the air pollution and the pollution to the environmental production of India and it's going to only make make it worse so I wanted to place your plans within the environmental capacities of India and what we can do and also I wanted to contextualize your plans within Congress's current governance structure and what your plans are given in India's environmental output
 this is the expression I hear from many many many many people I meet right every time someone says to me listen I don't have a job right they're expressing to me the idea that the state needs to figure out a way to give them a future
 there is no contradiction between producing and pollution fundamentally depends on the type of fuel you use on the type of energy you use and your strategy on how you're going to fuel that production
 also there are all different types of production there is agricultural production there is handicrafts there's a huge set of different types of activities that you can do and you can choose to do
 you can choose to do those which are very very polluting you can choose to do those which are not that polluting
 if you look at our pollution problem in our cities a lot of these problems can actually be solved with correct government intervention
 there's essentially that Delhi is being polluted because of industry that is sitting right outside Delhi
 you start to regulate that industry you start to transform the way they work you start improving the pollution in Delhi
 thank you let's move to the left side of the room and they somewhere in the back and then maybe move back to the problem
 by the way just isn't a site Germany produces right there's a lot of production taking place in Germany
 but the air looks pretty clean to me so right so this is the idea that if you produce you have to you know have pollution there
 yes to an extent is true but there are many things that you can do to ensure that you're producing at and damaging the environment less
 I'm not very good at grouping questions but let's try again one short question present yourself and then we'll take one from the very left end of myself
 thank you for being here I'm David I come from a region that had a painful call exit in Germany in the 70s
 and you talk a lot about energy transition so my question is how do you navigate the dialogue around climate change
 you have the historical responsibility that lies with Europe in the US but that moral superiority stands vis a vis
 a vis a vis practical considerations of we need to get places in terms of climate mitigation right
 so how do you navigate the conversational place where people have really different things at the top of their mind in terms of their income
 that's more important and then you have all of these coal regions where those are the bed rocks of the income
 so how do you navigate the conversations in your country
 for a country like India it's not an easy conversation but the difference between a country like Germany and India is that there's a huge amount of infrastructure that we are going to be building in the future
 and you have already built most of your infrastructure right so we can view green energy as a strategic advantage
 we can think about green energy as building a strategic advantage for us and we can think about using green energy for all the infrastructure that we are going to build in the future
 and we have scale so a lot of if we use green energy to build our infrastructure we build other capabilities then that we can give to other people
 so I don't view the idea of energy transition as a non strategic thing you can actually you can actually gain a huge strategic advantage by making this transition fast
 look at what China has done in electric vehicles they have using using a different form of mobility they are now having a huge competitive advantage
 you can see what the European and the auto industry is faced with because they have decided to move
 so for countries like ours where we have a lot of infrastructure to build and we have large scale we can actually do quite interesting things that transform the way energies used
 thank you over on this side
 hello I am Neema I am Hurtie alumni and I am from your neighboring country Nepal so my question to you is how you have got a new government
 yes yeah enter government and we are going into elections soon so my question how is that going so far it's going good we are at least in a good pace
 but I don't know like how the future looks like there are so many external actors playing around so which we are
 who are the external actors like they are especially like it's the Gen Z that they call but even a lot of Gen Zs are divided
 so there are every portcast and every interviews coming from different Gen Z groups so we are a bit concerned about that but hopefully everything stands out well
 so my question is also kind of revolving around that area like in this day and age of algorithmic divided world and driven world
 what advice do you want to give to emerging leaders who are trying to who are more tempted towards adopting more published way of strategy to mobilize their support
 and like campaigns how can people leaders can adopt more radical listening and then be more like kind to an infatic towards each other rather than being divided so that's my question
 what's your time frame?
 yeah what's your time frame what time frame are you thinking about? like are you thinking about three-year time frame or you thinking about a six-year time frame or you thinking about a 20-year time frame
 because the answer would be different long term then if you are not in a hurry this is a problem when most lot of guys come like this
 and they don't actually understand not you but they don't actually understand what it takes to do politics
 it's not a fun thing it really isn't a fun thing
 so the short term guys will come in and say you know I want to do this they'll identify a problem maybe they'll say I want to be a member of parliament
 and then they will go in and they will work on becoming a member of parliament right so that's what I mean when I say short term
 now that's a totally different idea and you can do that and a lot of people do that right that's somehow for me that was an interesting
 so then there's another system and the other system is you go into yourself and you say okay what is the thing that I will defend no matter what happens
 the one thing or the two things that I will defend and then you defend those things whatever it is now what happens in that system is it looks like you're going no way for a long time
 and people say this guy's crazy normally but after some time you start to you start to get traction
 so it's like you know you know compounding works you know compounding works it's like that so when you start compounding you can't really see anything
 and then you're like you know this doesn't work this doesn't work this doesn't work and then suddenly the thing starts to move
 so I don't think in my mind when I was your age which was that can you actually do politics by being truthful like everybody told me you can't
 everybody says listen if you're truthful forget it and then I realized it's actually the people are doing the short term game who are thinking that
 because if you're playing the five year game or the six year game then yes you know if you if you're truthful to the to somebody and you know he's going to decide whether your MP or not you're not becoming MP
 right but if you're thinking longer term then the truthful stuff becomes gold then it really starts to work so there are these two types of of politicians
 one who compounds trust and it's it's quite fascinating what starts to happen when you do it seriously it's actually mind blowing
 right it takes a long time and people think you're crazy people really think this guy's nuts but after some time the thing starts to work
 like I'll go I'll go to restaurants and people I don't know will say to me we love you just like that right and I discovered this I'm still answering your question by the way
 and I discovered this which is that I used to I used to start the thing as a politician or maybe when you're doing public policy
 you enter the room and you say I know what has to be done right and actually that's completely the wrong thing
 the best thing to do is when you enter room with five seven other people you say I actually don't know what needs to be done
 and I'm going to listen to what they think needs to be done and so you move from this thing of talking to yourself and building a little theory of the world in your mind
 and then trying to run it to suddenly going quiet and listening to what is this guy now going to say and then suddenly you start to see that wow
 I had no idea the level of understanding this former has no idea I mean like now I go to a former I just shut up I don't even talk
 because he's a master of his trade and anything I tell him about what he does is actually meaningless so to me it becomes once once you start once you say
 listen I'm going to go down the trust route then the next automatic step has to be I'm going to go down the listening route
 because if you if I'm going to build trust with Sam and I don't listen to him that's not happening so that to me if you're serious about politics
 that's where the real players are playing if you're not serious then do the five year thing seven year thing ten year thing maybe you'll succeed maybe you'll burn out but you want to enjoy yourself
 okay hi Raulji my name is Gayatri Sheshwar and I come from the state of Maharashtra which has a rich history of resistance and currently a lot of anger with the way the state politics has been butchered
 but since we are talking about learning to listen in a noisy world in this time of total ideological and institutional capture by the ruling government are we already beyond the point of no return when it comes to listening in the context of democracy and democratic processes
 and as my friend I sure I put it very well a lot of us who do not recognize the country that we grew in grew up in anymore we feel like you're kind of the only thing that's standing in between
 like those democracy that we knew and this really dystopian reality so well no pressure but my point is everything seems like noise where is the hope
 no see we you know in the beginning I said look we had a we had a model that worked for us from 1990 to I'd say 2012 13
 what Prime Minister Modi and the BJP in the RSS have done is they've extended that model
 so if you look if you look at what they're doing they have essentially taken the economic ideas of Manmoan Singh and taken them right to the extreme right where we wouldn't take them and we wouldn't allow them to go
 but what one has to realize is that the model is collapsed and the entire conversation that is taking place now including this conversation is about what does the next model of Indian growth look like
 what does that basic architecture look like I can tell you already that what Mr. Modi is trying to do economically reach the end of its possibilities about 4 to 5 years ago
 it is jammed it cannot go further he's got a problem because he's tied himself to two or three people who are not going to let it reverse
 even if he decides now that he wants to build a different type of model he can't do it he's stuck because he's invested too much in the Adhanis and the Ambani's of this world they know he's they control him
 so the real interesting thing for me is what does that new model look like and what I alluded to here is that it has to have production
 right it has to have a production that occurs in a democratic environment what he alluded which broadly I agree with is it has to have a vision for the environment
 it has to have a vision for the weaker sections of society but the more marginalized sections of society but it has to create prosperity it cannot just create prosperity for 10 businessmen or 50 businessmen or 100 businessmen it won't work
 so all the angst you're feeling is actually the collapse of a model and the hope is and in fact you people are going to help build it
 the hope is okay so this is not working what is the next idea and by the way don't think India hasn't gone through this India's gone through this in a much bigger way before
 right if you imagine what we did in 1947 it was a much bigger transition than is taking place today I'm not you know devoid of hope I'm actually quite excited about what this thing looks like five years, ten years
 into the future and I'm interested in understanding what the different stakeholders feel about it right so I'm interested in understanding what students feel about where our education system should go
 so you shouldn't and you come from you come from the state from from the state where the core of the resistance to the RSS idea comes so you you're right there you know you're where the battlefield is
 so the mic is over here we'll take one more and then two questions in the middle because we also have to watch that go
 may I use my micron of privileges to plug in a question of my own if that's okay hello wasekani thank you for being here today my name is Michelle I'm an MPP student
 a lot of us here have worked in the policy environment in India and it's very frustrating when good research policy analysis strategies are
 in the system but they're put on the back burner because they're not about issues that are electoral agenda issues
 but still very important press freedom women's representation in politics LGBTQ rights climate is one of them so as future policy makers and as citizens my question is
 do we just have to make peace with the fact that these issues will forever be back burner issues and perhaps if there is space in the agenda they might feature
 now you'd be you'd be surprised at the amount of room that exists in our system for non central issues but you have to know how to drive them
 right so for example if you if you there are many such issues that can be driven very easily through parliament if you get the right set of people interested in in the issue
 right you can't ignore the democratic process so you can't say that listen non you know peripheral issues are going to be the center they never
 but you can be sensitive to peripheral issues and you can have a mindset where you say okay this is not a central issue but we'll we'll make it important you know for example
 in an issue that comes to mind is the tiger non central issue right but became a very important issue because of how you framed it right so framing is very important
 right how you think about putting it across how you think about framing it how you're positioning the issue that that is what allows peripheral issues to become central
 right my name is ace chowdory my dad is an immigrant from India my mom's parents are Pakistani and she was born raised among this and also immigrants the states
 my question for you is maybe changing the tone a little bit but my question is India has a growing defense dependence on Israel as they are the largest importer of Israeli weapons nearly 40% of Israeli surveillance technologies and arms are bought by India
 I know you're saying superpowers are dwindling no terribly society and economically how do you view the future risks of deepening this relationship with Israel while India seeks to position itself with autonomy as an independent little power no we we buy weapons
 thank you we buy weapons from a number of people yes we buy weapons from Israel we buy weapons from the Russians we buy weapons from the Americans we buy them from the French
 and in a complex environment we have to defend ourselves we are trying to become self sufficient in that space there's a long distance to go
 but we can't get away from the fact that we need to buy weapons from the best possible supplier right we're not going to buy second rate weapons we're going to buy the best weapons that we need but on the matter of Israel
 I think what Hamas did was absolutely wrong but I think what Israel has done to the people of Gaza is absolutely wrong as well and I think the bombing of women and children simply should not happen so I think that that is something that I feel strongly about and I think responsible people should think about that
 think about what has happened to final questions let me share that you have the mic and then one bit more to the front somebody else has to grab the
 if you can group them if you hold your answer to the question we have a little bit more time to go ahead to present yourself
 thank you Max Meehan from Laan the co-founder of the indogerman young leaders forum in NGO we founded 10 years ago to bring India and Germany more closely together
 basically a very long run initiative so I connected closely to what you said if you want proper results they will be 10 20 30 years down the line so my question for you is not political but really targeting the leaders that we are all achieving trying to be at some point
 so is there with all the experience you had in meeting leaders around the globe is there any advice that you could give German young leaders learning from India or from Indian leadership experiences and the other way around
 thank you the visual representation of a leader if I ask you can you can you visually you know imagine a leader with people what you see is a guy walking in front
 and a whole bunch of people walking behind right right my visual representation is walking behind them
 so I I really liked a tau is quote I read once which I don't remember the exact quote but basically it says that nobody hears or sees the work of a leader
 and once it's done they think they did it themselves right so to me to me a leaders much more about connection about empathy about listening then about getting people to follow you
 the following happens as a result of the listening and the empathy and the following is is almost a byproduct
 you know so now this sounds is so terrible sounds as if it doesn't work but it does I I I do it all the time
 I'll tell you before I went before I went walking and actually I didn't walk 8000 kilometers from I worked 4000 kilometers from north to south
 but then the one that went from east to west was little bit of walking but a lot of car so so you're giving me credit for something I didn't do
 so so I work 4000 from the southern most tip to the northern most tip and I realized two things in that in that work
 the first one was that as a politician I didn't even know how to listen to people
 like I didn't I didn't even begin to understand what it means to listen to people because I was always ready to you know your politician you want to tell people what you think
 you already assumed that I know better and I'm going to tell you what to think this is the model it's a model of all modern politicians
 so the first thing I realized is actually I don't listen at all and listening by the way includes the listening is not talking to yourself while the other person is talking
 you know what I mean I'm listening to you and then I'm saying yeah okay you know she's winning a red shirt and all that
 that's not listening listening is silence in your mind when the other person is talking
 that you're looking and you're silent and there's nothing going on and you're looking at what they're saying you're looking at the way they're expressing themselves
 you're looking at the tightness in their body you're looking at that so you're trying to make as deeper connection with the person as you possibly can
 and you're giving them the stage fully and you're not trying to bounce around in the stage next to them
 so that's the first thing the second thing which completely blew my mind was we were walking on the on the yatra
 and I saw this guy trying to come in there was a huge crowd there we used to walk in the morning and there was a huge crowd
 and this guy was trying to come in and the cops were stopping him so they stopped him first he tried to come in they stopped him they hid him
 and I looked and I was like oh you know I told the guy was walking me like you know he's trying to talk to us go in, go in and try and get him inside
 because it's a big crowd anyway by the time he arrived at the guy had gone and then again few hours later I saw him on this side
 same thing and he had gone and this happened a couple of times and then at the end I said listen the moment you see that guy
 please bring him here I told my office guy so the moment he saw me brought him and he brought him that guy broke free of my office guy
 and came running and then he started going like this to me so I said what so he said I know what you're doing
 so I said what am I doing he says no no no I know what you're doing so I said what am I doing and then he said in Hindi
 now you do you understand what I just said no what he said is what he said is that in a supermarket of hatred
 you're opening a shop of love and that thing no I went and gave a speech after that and I said you know I said that line
 and that line went like a earthquake which is literally went like an earthquake across the country
 and then everybody asks me how did you think that thing up and I'm like I didn't think that thing up
 right that thing came to me from the crowd so the other thing is that intelligence lies in the crowd
 and you got a goal listen for it intelligence is something that is innate is there and it talks to you
 and then I realized that that that holy atra it was talking to me not as an individual it was talking as an individual
 but it was talking as a group that statement that I made was not an individual statement it was a statement that was in the mind of thousands of people he just expressed it
 so then I started to notice that this crowd is talking to me as not as an individual person but as an organism
 so those are the two learnings that completely transform the way I think about this and I think those are central to leadership
 you're sitting I'm sitting with this group of people there's an individual intelligence in you
 there's also a connected intelligence in you that comes with your particular experience I have to pay attention to both
 so thank you for all these answers I saw Mujji shake head his hand up and I would I would love to give you a lightning round question
 if it's very short it can be answered with one sentence if not I'll have you walk up but if you can go ahead with the very final final final final
 thank you very much I think I will very impressed and thank you for showing up today and giving us the opportunity listen to you
 I wish you know you taught the policy process course to our students instead of me so maybe at some point that happens
 so I don't say this often but you know my dad is a rickshaw driver was a rickshaw driver in India
 so I've broken that socio-economic barrier to be here in Germany today as a professor at this place
 but there are many like me in India who are unable to do that especially from the community I come from which is you know the mostly minority in India
 I want to know what your vision is for them going forward because we don't I mean I haven't really heard of that today in your talk
 so if in a sentence you can say that
 for me every single Indian regardless of religion, language you know what his father does
 should have the freedom to have a vision of his own life and should be able to express that vision and act on that vision
 I don't separate people in quadrants of language religion in my mind
 and I don't like the idea that anybody should be scared in India
 this disturbs me so when the minority community feels scared in India or the Dalit community feels scared in India
 or the tribal community feels scared in India or a woman who's walking outside at night feels scared in India
 I don't like that and so for me that is something that needs to be worked on and that is something to me that is a vision of India
 where there is harmony and everybody can express themselves you have a particular religious predisposition
 somebody else has another one there's no conflict between them
 if you go to the root of all religions you'll find they're saying very similar things
 so to me I value how many I value connection I value respect and I think an India that gives its people all its people respect connection is the India that I would look forward to
 that's a closing word if I've ever heard one so thank you very much Mr. Gandhi
