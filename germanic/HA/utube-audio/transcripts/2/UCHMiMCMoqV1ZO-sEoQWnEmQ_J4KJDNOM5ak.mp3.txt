 Distinguished Enderlein Fellows,
 Dier Johannes, Dier John, Dier Maria,
 Dier Magdalina Kirchenhard,
 Dier Wolfgang Ruhr and Friends of the Shiftung Mercato,
 Dier Anton Hofreiter, Dier faculty,
 students, staff, guests, and friends of the Herdy School.
 And most importantly,
 Dier Isabel Enderlein on behalf of the entire family.
 It is my great pleasure to welcome you here tonight
 at the Herdy School for our Henryk Enderlein Fellowship Lecture
 and discussion entitled, Open but Not Defenseless,
 Protecting Europe from Hybrid Threats.
 Tonight's event is co-hosted by our Center for International Security,
 the Jacques de lauze Center,
 and the Center for Fundamental Rights,
 and I would like to thank all the colleagues
 who made the special evening possible.
 Tonight we are welcoming our fourth Henryk Enderlein Fellow,
 Maria Golupiewa.
 Maria, it's wonderful to have you join the ranks
 of the Henryk Enderlein Fellows.
 We're very, very much looking forward to hearing your take
 on Europe's challenges and its response
 to Hybrid Threats in just a few minutes.
 This fellowship,
 Genesysupported by the Shiftung Mercato continues
 to embody the legacy of the late Henryk Enderlein,
 who inspired us to bridge academia and real world problems
 all while striving towards an ever more integrated Europe.
 We will learn more on Henryk's vision and legacy
 from Johannes Lindner in just a few minutes.
 After that, Shiftung Mercato's director
 of the Center for Europe in the world, Magdalena Kirchner,
 will speak more on what makes Maria Golupiewa,
 such an extraordinary Enderlein Fellow.
 And I would like to thank Shiftung Mercato very much
 for their continued support
 for this important initiative honoring Henryk's legacy.
 Part of this fellowship is also a small tradition
 that I'm very happy to continue tonight.
 We give our new Enderlein Fellows a notebook.
 It is a simple object, but one that carries meaning.
 It's a place to jot down ideas
 to sketch out the beginnings of big projects,
 or even just to capture thoughts
 from a late night discussion.
 This notebook is attributed to Henryk,
 who never was without a notebook to ensure
 he didn't lose any of his ideas.
 And interestingly, he had a notebook
 that should fit what's it called, the pocket,
 that you can carry on the inside of your vest.
 So Johannes, who is very attached to this,
 was very eager to have the right size.
 This clearly is more for ladies' handpick.
 It's a bit smaller.
 There's absolutely no thinking in it,
 but we do think it's good to have a big notebook,
 so Maria, this is yours.
 (audience applauding)
 Thank you.
 Now I would like to be short,
 and thank everyone for joining us this evening.
 I'm very much looking forward to the discussion later
 with Maria, with John Ryan, and with Anton Hofreiter.
 And this discussion will be moderated by the director
 of the Center for International Security
 and Professor of International Affairs
 and Security, Julian Wuchafenich.
 So in order to get there as fast as we can,
 I would like to pass the floor to Johannes Lindner
 for his opening remarks.
 Thank you very much.
 (audience applauding)
 - Now many thanks, Cornelia.
 This is the third time that we are holding this event,
 an event where the ongoing Henry Ganderline Fellow
 passes on to the incoming Henry Ganderline Fellow
 with the lecture, but also,
 and in the possibility to engage in a discussion
 with the public and with policymakers.
 And I'm glad to see Anton Hofreiter among us again.
 We always meet in mid September,
 not only because it marks the beginning of the academic year,
 but also because it's close to Henry Ganderline's birthday.
 Last Saturday, Henry would have turned 51.
 This fellowship bears his name,
 and it is in his memory that we do this tradition.
 Isabel, thank you for being here with us.
 And as the first Henry Ganderline Fellow,
 and someone that knew Henry Gwell,
 Cornelia asked me to say a few words
 that shares a bit his personality,
 but also his way of thinking with you,
 and maybe also be an inspiration
 for all of us Henry Gander Fellowes,
 and in particular, you Maria.
 There are two aspects I want to highlight.
 The first is the connection between analysis and practice.
 Henry was a true policy entrepreneur.
 For him, rigorous analysis always mattered,
 but equally important was using that analysis
 to shape and enrich the political debate.
 He had the special energy and the conviction
 that each of us has the power
 to change the course of politics.
 The second was his unwavering focus on the European Union.
 He was of the view that the creation of the European Union
 was one of the key achievements,
 the great achievement of the post-war era.
 And he understood the union,
 not merely as an economic community,
 but as a political union and compassing
 a wide range of policies from the euro to defense.
 Now, I thought it would be good to illustrate this
 with one memorable event.
 And I'm grateful to Nicole König
 from the Munich Security Conference
 to remind me of that one.
 She used to be a close collaborator of Henryk.
 And it was in February 2020
 at the Munich Security Conference,
 Henryk holds a very exclusive close door breakfast
 with President Macron.
 Macron and Henryk, of course, were close.
 They knew each other for a long time.
 And in fact, at some point,
 Henryk had offered Macron to join as a fellow
 at the Jacques de laurre center.
 Of course, he decided differently
 and took a different route and became president later on.
 At that breakfast, key figures of German foreign
 and security policy were present.
 And in fact, many more wanted to join that exclusive gathering.
 The discussion, 2020,
 centered on Macron's concept of strategic sovereignty.
 Macron anticipated two themes that today
 are at this very center of our debate,
 autonomy and security.
 And at the time, both of them were still relatively unfamiliar
 or contested within the EU.
 And in fact, many of the German establishment
 present responded rather cautiously to Macron.
 On autonomy, many saw the EU primarily
 as part of a broader continuum of international cooperation.
 And autonomy smacked of inefficient protectionism
 and even isolationism.
 On security, the EU was in a comfortable division of labor
 focusing on growth and trade
 and leaving defense and security to NATO and the US.
 This, of course, overlooked the risk of dependency,
 the threat of war.
 And the threat to peace, the threat of war
 and internal vulnerabilities of our own democracies.
 Today, we find ourselves in the midst of a transformation
 that seeks to address these shortcomings,
 both at national and EU level.
 But at the EU level in particular,
 this transformation will be very demanding.
 And I feel it will require going deeper
 than many of us have yet realized.
 Let's have this debate on the necessary changes
 and let's have this debate with the energy
 and the broad vision that Henry brought to the union.
 With this, I'm looking forward to our discussion today
 and I'm glad to hand over to Madeline.
 (audience applauding)
 - Okay, Professor Wall, the Johannes,
 Timis Enderlein, their colleagues, guests.
 On behalf of Stift on MacArthur,
 I'm delighted to join you today here at the Hatter School
 at the Henry Enderlein Forum
 to mark the transition of the Henry Enderlein Fellowship,
 a program that we proudly support since 2022
 and that reflects our shared commitment
 to a democratic, a strong, ender resilient Europe.
 The fellowship stands for what Stift on MacArthur
 deeply values the connection between academic excellence
 and policy relevance.
 Between ideas and action,
 between Europe as a vision and Europe as a lived reality,
 it honors Henry Enderlein,
 a trusted friend of our foundation
 and a passionate European who believed that good policy
 must be grounded in rigorous thinking,
 in bold leadership and in meaningful discussions.
 Through this fellowship, we support individuals
 who embody these principles
 and who contribute to shaping Europe's future.
 Let me therefore quickly begin by expressing
 our sincere appreciation to John Morein
 our outgoing fellow.
 His work on the foundations of democracy
 and the rule of law and the EU
 has addressed some of the most pressing issues
 that are continent faces today.
 I'm sure that John's academic leadership,
 his policy inside his enthusiasm has made
 equally a lasting impact here at the Heritage School
 as it has in our own community of grantees,
 scholarship holders, and partners of which
 I already spotted some here in the room
 where also I'm sure came to bid farewell.
 Thank you, John, for your dedication.
 We look forward to the continued impact of your research.
 And now it's my great pleasure to welcome Maria Gorabyeva
 as the next Hendrick Enderlein fellow.
 She brings a remarkable blend of academic expertise
 of policy experience and strategic foresight
 as she has built her career at the intersection
 of policy making, facademia, and think tank research.
 After earning a PhD from the University of Cambridge,
 she worked for the Consultancy Company, ICF, and Brussels
 and later on as an independent consultant
 for European institutions in the Western Balkans
 and even in Central Asia.
 She then taught politics at Regastrad and University
 and worked at the Think Tank Providos
 where she led public policy research on a range of topics,
 including democratic participation and migration.
 And then she entered the National Politics of her country,
 Latvia from 2018 to '22.
 She was a member of the parliament
 and also the chair of the European Affairs Committee
 in 2021 until '22.
 She served as the Minister of Interior
 a crucial time if you think that she also designed
 and implement the Latvian response
 to the Ukraine refugee crisis caused by Russia's full invasion
 into Ukraine at that time.
 I think we're all very eager to hear from your experience
 and to learn from you.
 She's also a founder of a crisis simulation,
 startup malaise, and a distinguished fellow
 at the Center for European Policy Analysis
 in Washington DC, SIPA.
 What will she work on?
 The focus of her fellowship on EU responses
 to hybrid threats as you can already gather
 from the title of her lecture could not be more timely.
 From cyber attacks to infrastructures, sabotage
 and disinformation campaigns,
 Europe faces really complex challenges
 that demand agile data-driven and coordinated responses.
 How the EU can develop these will not only be the guiding
 question of our discussion tonight,
 but is alitmost test for our continent's future.
 We are looking forward and excited to see Maria engage
 with the Center for International Security here
 at the Heritage School.
 She will contribute to executive education
 and foster new connections between research and practice.
 Without mentioning, obviously,
 we are also thrilled to welcome you into our own
 Macaturglob community of partners, grantees and fellows
 and would invite you to SN, if you ever make it that way.
 The Hendrick Enderline fellowship is more
 than just a research opportunity.
 It's a platform for dialogue,
 for innovation and for European cooperation.
 We thank the Heritage School for this inspiring partnership.
 We look forward to Maria Golobieva's keynote,
 open but not defenseless, and a title that speaks
 to both the urgency and the optimism
 of our shared European project.
 The floor is you, yours, thank you so much.
 (audience applauding)
 - Right.
 Dear Cornelia, dear Mr. Lindner, dear Anton,
 John and Julian, dear representatives of Macaturg,
 Stiftung, the community of Heritage School,
 ladies and gentlemen.
 It is an incredible honor to be standing here today
 as the next Hendrick Enderline fellow.
 And I only hope that I will be able to justify
 some of the hopes just expressed by Ms. Kirschner.
 I have cherished my cooperation with Heritage School
 even before I got this fellowship.
 And I'm very much looking forward to cooperation
 with the Center for International Security,
 which is new for me, in my research
 on European policy response to hybrid threats.
 Since the outbreak of the full scale invasion
 in Ukraine by Russia, challenge to Europe's security
 has been mostly discussed in terms of military readiness.
 And indeed, military readiness is very relevant
 in this context.
 But there is a parallel and equally pressing issue
 of threats that our country is already face on a daily basis.
 And these are known to us as the hybrid threats.
 And they include cyber attacks,
 they include physical sabotage of critical infrastructure.
 They also include information operations,
 which are not very visible,
 remain invisible to the majority of European citizens
 as a rule, but at the same time,
 they exploit the vulnerabilities of our societies.
 The purpose of hybrid attacks is multi faceted.
 They have many purposes.
 One is to test the vulnerabilities,
 as I mentioned before, of critical infrastructure.
 Another one is to undermine society
 and governments to undermine institutions.
 But very importantly, it's also to undermine
 more intangible democratic institutions,
 including the free press and the democratic open debate
 in our societies.
 And a threat actors pursue these goals and other goals
 in both the physical domain,
 when for example, they put fire to some warehouse
 or cause some damage to a railway,
 but also more frequently in the cyber domain
 and increasingly also in the information space.
 The scale of disruption caused by hybrid attacks
 ranges from small to very significant.
 And geographically, they span the whole of Europe
 from a massive attack on the Millennium Bank in Portugal,
 which disrupted banking operations for quite a while.
 Two, for example, the disruption of undersea cables
 in the Baltic Sea connecting the Baltic States
 and the Northern Europe.
 So there is a very Europe-wide geographical span.
 And it is also important to map out not just the geography,
 but also the main dimensions of the challenge
 that this presents.
 A hybrid threats present a challenge not just
 to our security, but also to liberal democracy as such
 and to the European project.
 And it's important to see to what extent
 these dimensions are reflected in the European policy.
 First of all, there is the dimension
 of weaponized physical connectivity.
 From penetrating operational systems
 of utility companies to cutting undersea cables,
 this dimension has been much discussed recently
 because of some more visible episodes.
 It is generally a more visible dimension
 because the damage is physical and usually immediate.
 But even here, some threat types are not sufficiently anticipated.
 For example, recently when President Fondelian's plane
 could not land in Bulgaria
 because of electronic warfare, German or spoofing,
 the news reports very much focused on danger to planes,
 but actually electronic warfare is dangerous,
 not just for planes, but also for energy infrastructure,
 connectivity, communications.
 And this is just one example of a type
 of largely untested threat.
 But apart from weaponized connectivity,
 there is also weaponized information space
 where illicit campaigns undermine trust,
 including trust in Europe.
 As Mark Linnard of European Council and Foreign Relations
 has aptly put it in his book,
 we have entered the age of unpeace.
 And peace time assumptions no longer hold.
 Even if it comes to the daily operations
 of things that make up the physical pattern of our life,
 the banking system, the energy system, et cetera,
 electric grids might fail because of some operation.
 But we're still processing the psychological shock.
 We keep doing it from 2022.
 Changing Europe's mindset to turn out
 to be a matter of years rather than days.
 I think it's important to note that while Europe
 is no longer living in denial of this new reality,
 there is a lot of discussion going on
 about how to tackle it.
 Europe is still figuring out its response.
 And I believe that I will only be able to date
 focus on the domestic security aspect of this response
 because there is also the cooperation with NATO,
 there is also the resilience of society,
 I will not be covering those issues,
 but I will look at the policies
 which the European institutions are pursuing.
 And I have to say that so far,
 the EU's record on countering hybrid threats
 has been uneven.
 The domain work coordination is more obvious
 and where it has been a bit more advanced.
 And the data sharing works best so far
 is arguably the EU cybersecurity policy.
 With strong standards set by NIS to directive
 and additional, although optional architecture
 created by the Cyber Solidarity Act,
 which entered into force this year.
 There is a responsible agency, ANISA,
 which has more tasks since those new acts were adopted.
 And even here, it's not always easy
 to reconcile EU-level coordination
 with national sovereignty and to exercise technical mandate
 in a changing political landscape.
 The EU Cyber Solidarity Act has established
 European Cyber Security Alert System,
 which is made up of security operation centers
 interconnected across the EU
 and a comprehensive emergency mechanism.
 However, the Act maintains voluntary participation
 of member states in crucial areas
 where lack of shared situation awareness
 and a swift coordinated response may constitute a weakness.
 And the speed of reaction becomes more relevant
 with the development and application of AI in this statement,
 is in this domain.
 Another area is the more physical, traditional physical
 sabotage, which used to be a feature of wartime reality
 before.
 Today, it's a new everyday reality in Europe.
 And in this area, the EU has also
 some new policies remarkably the critical entities
 directive, but member states have not yet fully adopted it
 in their legislation.
 And most work is being done by national security agencies.
 Sometimes cooperating with among themselves
 and often in coordination with national decision makers,
 but much less often in cooperation
 with European decision makers.
 This is the area we're getting a full picture
 of what is happening across Europe in real time.
 It's difficult.
 And I would dare to suggest that even EU intelligence
 and situation center probably does not
 have the picture of what is happening today,
 but in the best case of what has been happening yesterday.
 The Nenister report presented in 2024
 to the European institutions by the former Finnish
 president, Sallin Nenister, contained
 many useful recommendations on the EU security policy
 and among those recommendations,
 it advocated a European anti-subitage network
 that would support member states in preventing
 and responding to sabotage incidents
 and build on existing EU level cooperation
 like a critical entities resilience group.
 Such a network has not yet been established.
 And there are indications that it is politically not easy
 to establish one.
 If we look away from cybersecurity
 and physical security of infrastructure,
 we still have the information space,
 which is the supposed arena of cognitive warfare.
 Its protection is conceptualized in the European Union
 as fighting foreign information, manipulation,
 and interference of FEMA.
 There is sufficient awareness of the impact
 of information operations on public trust in Europe.
 The German public has been alerted
 to the dangers of foreign information manipulation
 by the book by Antt Vrituk for Loringhofen
 and Leon Erlinhorst, Putin's Ungrief of Deutschland.
 And the book describes multiple large-scale information
 manipulation campaigns by Russian actors
 and pro-Russian actors underlining basically the damage
 that those have on German democratic politics.
 Other EU member states have also suffered
 from similar campaigns.
 And some of them have already established
 national agencies for countering them,
 remarkably France's vision and Sweden's
 psychological defense agency.
 This domain also has some emerging European architecture,
 but it is less comprehensive.
 Response mechanisms in this area are slower
 and thoroughly dependent on political decisions.
 Similar to cyber incidents response,
 the framework includes a rapid alerts
 during significant disinformation campaigns,
 but their activation requires individual assessment
 by member states or EU institutions
 rather than an automatically triggered reaction.
 This is too slow for today's threat environment
 and again too slow given the development of AI.
 Another limitation is the use of reactive approaches.
 For example, the EU level center for sharing
 and analysis on foreign information manipulation,
 FEMA ISAC created in 23,
 analyzes the tactics, techniques and procedures
 used by actors in influence operations,
 but their method, the method of FEMA ISAC is primarily
 analyzing and collating information,
 enabling automated sharing, sometimes of threat intelligence,
 but there is no proactive action taken
 against this information actors.
 There exists a more proactive framework,
 which is called derail or directing response
 against illicit influence operations,
 and it focuses specifically on actively disrupting
 influence operations rather than merely analyzing them.
 Its objectives include the increase
 in situational awareness, reduction of illicit actors'
 capabilities to produce content,
 and ultimately the deterrence effect on threat actors.
 For instance, making them disappear
 from a given platform because it no longer pays off
 to continue operating.
 This is the approach the EU could take,
 but it hasn't taken it yet.
 A valuable feature of this approach
 is that it protects liberal democracy
 by fighting information operations asymmetrically
 outside of the information spaces,
 avoiding so-called counter-disinformation campaigns.
 There exists this simplistic perception
 that the main goal of influence campaigns
 is to spread false information,
 and that means that we should debunk this information
 or fight back by adopting some of the same tactics.
 Now, to quote Karl Miller, who is one of the minds
 behind the derail framework,
 using the same techniques that the information operations
 actors are using against them
 is going to be a losing strategy for democracies.
 Liberal democracies have most of benefit
 from information spaces that are protected,
 and most to lose from information spaces that are weaponized
 because they are neither used nor trusted.
 In other words, we should go after the actors
 who weaponize our information spaces
 and not contribute ourselves to their weaponization.
 What illicit campaign's target is not information
 but behavior.
 They use information that may be actually true,
 but they repress some facts and favor other facts
 to foster different discourses of patriotism, identity,
 gender, among other things,
 with a goal to polarize divide and undermine.
 Threat actors often see key features of liberal democracy,
 openness of information and democratic debate
 as vulnerabilities.
 So our response should then take stock of these purposes
 and avoid falling into exactly the kind of traps
 that are being set,
 which means our response should not lead
 to a permanent weakening of the open and democratic nature
 of our societies and political institutions.
 And this is more difficult if we decide
 to face these challenges primarily at the national level.
 Where security policies are captured
 by the short-term concerns of the electoral cycle,
 rule of law and fundamental rights often be to retreat.
 Citizens' sense of insecurity often amplified
 by illicit campaigns on social media
 sometimes leads to political reactions
 that target the symbolic presence of the other
 in our midst rather than tackle direct
 but less visible threats from male-ine actors.
 Just as an example, searching for ways
 to stem the flow of students from third countries
 to our universities,
 or announcing grades to check the documents of migrant workers
 is easier and politically may pay off faster
 than establishing a sophisticated dynamic system
 of early warning, prevention and protection
 from hybrid threats.
 But the more we let our security policy be captured
 by populism,
 the less it responds to the complexity
 of gross-border challenges,
 including hybrid warfare.
 Witness the US administration's decision
 to terminate cooperation with Europe
 on fighting for an information manipulation and interference,
 which has serious implications for transatlantic responses
 to disruptive campaigns from states like Russia, China and Iran.
 To incentivize political leaders to take the more complicated route
 that doesn't undermine liberal democracy
 by increasing polarization is not easy.
 But I believe one of the possible ways to do it in Europe
 is to have a more comprehensive European security policy,
 also in the domains of countering hybrid threats.
 The European dimension of our response
 should be strengthened not just because we need to pool resources
 and share intelligence,
 but also because Europe can add a level of democratic control
 and promote higher standards.
 A more European security policy is an antidote
 to growing global risks of authoritarianism.
 The task is multi-layered.
 We need to protect not just our citizens
 and infrastructure from male-ine actors,
 but also ensure the resilience
 of our liberal democracy in the face of these threats.
 This can be done,
 provided that Europe is able to act quickly
 and decisively in most cases,
 if the joint response is not just political,
 but also primarily operational and data-driven.
