 Hallo, guten Morgen und willkommen zu der Herdyschool.
 Mein Name ist Marina Henke, ich bin ein Professor
 in der Herdyschool und ich bin gelistet
 zu heute's event,
 kompeten Visionen der EU-Gohren-Forgheit.
 Die Event ist fundiert by the DRD
 und ist eine Ko-Produktion
 der Kissen-Tressenter der Z eyes
 Johns Hopkins und ich bin gelistet
 zu haben Frank Gavin hier in der
 Ruhmhose-Direktor der Kissen-Tressenter
 der Z eyes Johns Hopkins
 und der Herdysentur für internationalen Security.
 Ich denke, dass es nicht so gut ist, dass die EU
 einen kritischen Inflation-Pot erreicht hat.
 Die EU war unverkehrt für den Ruhmhose-Salt in Ukraine,
 ohne die Erdbewerb und die Sport von NATO und,
 natürlich, die Welt ist,
 die EU in der Erdbewerb nicht in der EU-Gohren-Forgheit,
 die EU-Krähen-Defend-Und-Zell-Frage,
 und die Effekte von sechs Monaten
 von den USA-Fragen von den USA-Fragen von den EU-Krähen-Defend-Und-Zell-Frage.
 Aber since February 24/2022
 EU-Member-States have,
 natürlich, start it,
 to rethink Europe's future
 und die Rolle der Sicherheit und der
 Offenklichkeit in den EU-Gohren-Frage.
 Nevertheless, die Diskussion sind
 nicht die Diskussion zu haben.
 Sie haben die
 "Foundations-Foundations"
 von der EU-Union,
 was ist der EU-Union?
 Was ist es supposed to do
 für its Member-States,
 für Europe, für die Welt?
 Was resources can
 und will it mobilise
 to shape the global environment?
 In my opinion,
 the process of finding answers
 to these questions
 has the potential
 to tear the EU apart,
 but equally
 to revive the European project
 and start a fresh.
 Today, we will discuss a variety
 of visions of the European Union
 going forward,
 and we have a truly
 phenomenal lineup
 of panelists,
 who will provide us
 with food for thought.
 In alphabetical order,
 we have Benindetta Berti,
 Head of Policy Planning
 in the Office of the Secretary-General
 of NATO in Brussels,
 and I can think of no better person
 to highlight how NATO
 and the European Union
 can cooperate
 to manage Europe's future together.
 They have Charlie Lando,
 he's a senior research associate
 and manager at the Belfast Center
 at Harvard,
 an expert on transatlantic relations,
 and today, with the verdict
 on Trump coming in,
 I think we all woke up to it.
 He has, I'm sure,
 very interesting things to say.
 We have two UN Deputy Director
 of the Jacques DeLorne Center
 at the Hurley School
 and a member of the Franco-German
 expert group
 on EU institutional reform,
 so from a Franco-German perspective,
 I can also think of no one better
 to fill us in on what Germany
 and France are thinking.
 Unfortunately, the Vigula,
 who was also on the program,
 had to cancel due to illness last minute.
 So, all our esteemed panelists
 will, for roughly five minutes,
 outline their visions
 of Europe going forward.
 Then I will ask them some questions
 and we will open up for Q&A.
 But before,
 I hand over to them,
 I first would like to take a poll
 in the audience.
 And I would like to know
 what you think will happen
 to the European Union.
 So, the question is,
 in ten years' time,
 do you think the European Union
 will be stronger than today
 and have a truly functioning
 security arm,
 maybe even including a European army?
 Who thinks that this is
 a possibility?
 Please raise your hand.
 [Laughter]
 Okay, I think that's maybe
 a third of the room?
 Who thinks that will not happen?
 It's an impossibility.
 Okay, that's,
 I would say it's probably
 like a quarter.
 And who doesn't know?
 Things that's too sensitive of a question.
 Okay.
 Well, I see like at least a third,
 thirty percent,
 or optimist in the room.
 So, that's, I think,
 it's a very good start.
 And we will start with Natalie Tachi,
 who was the, sorry, Natalie,
 actually, I haven't introduced you yet,
 but I'm absolutely delighted that you're here,
 the director of the Institute
 of Afari International in Rome.
 And she's been a special adviser
 to the EU-hyper-Presentatives,
 Mogurene and Borrell.
 And of course, in this capacity,
 I would vote the European Global Strategy
 and worked on its implementation.
 And Natalie, I would like to start with you
 because I know you have to leave early.
 So, you wrote the European Global Strategy
 and laying out a first draft vision
 for the European Union,
 much of course has happened since 2016.
 So, if you could revise this document,
 how would it look like today in 2024?
 Well, firstly, thank you very much.
 So, having me and it's great to be there
 would be it virtually.
 So, perhaps, you know,
 on your particular question,
 how would I revise it?
 My rather blunt answer is that I wouldn't.
 And why wouldn't I?
 Not because what was written in 2016
 is necessarily the best possible thing
 that could be written today.
 But because I actually don't think
 that EU's time is best spent at this point in time
 in writing strategies.
 This is really a time for action.
 And in many respects, you know,
 a strategy for the European Union,
 which of course is different from a state,
 is in many respects an identity building process.
 It is something that you can afford to do
 in that particular way,
 by working on documents,
 when things are,
 I wouldn't say stable,
 because they're never stable.
 I mean, they certainly weren't in 2014, 2015, 2016,
 when that particular piece of work was being carried out.
 But they were far more stable than they are today.
 I mean, today, in a sense,
 it would be somewhat surreal
 that you started embarking on a two and a half, three-year process,
 aimed at writing a strategy.
 So that's perhaps my slightly cheeky answer to your question.
 But I kind of reconnect to something that isn't listed in it.
 Earlier I was saying,
 the reason why you write a strategy is
 because a strategy for an entity like the European Union
 is an identity building process.
 And so through, for instance,
 you can do this in different ways,
 but you can also do it through a strategy
 by working on a common project,
 which can be a document,
 or it can be, you know, a particular action,
 you build the identity of the European Union,
 and particularly you build an identity which is more cohesive
 and united.
 And here we come back, in a sense,
 to the title of this conference,
 which is precisely about the diversity of Europe
 and its unity.
 And I wanted to sort of pick on this question,
 and sort of embed it back into,
 in the sense of much narrower,
 but perhaps more relevant for the European forum policy question,
 which is, you know,
 if you ask, you know, we could do another poll here.
 If you asked participants in the room,
 which is the main problem that prevents the EU
 from having a forum policy?
 And if, you know, one were to probably take the poll,
 I am guessing that the vast majority would basically say,
 its divisions between member states.
 So divisions between member states,
 as, in a sense, the condition that prevents Europe
 from having a cohesive action,
 and that prevents it from having an effective forum policy,
 and which is, you know, something like things like a strategy
 to try and aim to bridge over.
 And I wanted to sort of pick on this question of division,
 and in a sense, challenge it.
 Challenge the fact that actually this is the main problem
 when it comes to Europe's role in the world.
 And look at it by looking both at what has been happening
 in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but then also what has been happening
 in the Middle East.
 And these are very different stories,
 which actually, and perhaps paradoxically,
 point to the same conclusion, I think.
 So I think in the case of Ukraine, actually, you know,
 one could tell a fairly upbeat,
 if you're looking at it from the inside out, right?
 So if you're looking at it from the perspective of Europe outwards,
 and therefore a European forum policy,
 you could say, well, you know, I mean, we're doing really well here.
 I mean, obviously the war's not going very well,
 but that's a different, in a sense, conversation.
 But we're doing pretty well in the sense that actually,
 you know, if we had taken a lovable, you know,
 sort of two years ago, and we would have asked, you know,
 people in the room, would you, you know, do you think
 that the European Union will remain united
 to, and almost a half years on from Russia's large-scale
 invasion of Ukraine, very likely that the answer would have been,
 no, we were, you know, we were divided.
 You know, I remember sort of debates back in the summer of 2022,
 when it was all about how, you know, you see the divisions,
 there's the peace camp, and there's a justice camp,
 and those divisions are going to play out.
 And I think it's fair to say that if you're looking at it
 from different angles, you can basically say that,
 actually, that unity has prevailed.
 Whether you're looking at it through the angle of sanctions,
 the 4-T world, by now, you're going on to 14 packages of sanctions.
 Whether you're looking through the angle of enlargement,
 moving forward on the enlargement process,
 not only these heavy Ukraine and Maldiver,
 or Georgia obviously now has become a different,
 sort of, you know, basket case of its own,
 but also moving forward with the West and Balkans,
 whether you're looking at it through the angle of energy,
 through the angle of hosting refugees.
 You know, whatever angle you're looking at it,
 in the multiple dimensions of Russia's invasion of Ukraine
 and Europe's approach to it, you basically say,
 "Ha, well, you know, I mean, unity here has prevailed."
 Now, yes, of course, unity at times has a price,
 or perhaps I should more accurately say, "A bribe," right?
 I mean, it is clear that in order to ensure that unity,
 one particular member states, and of course, that's hungry,
 has repeatedly had to be bribed in different shapes and forms.
 And I think it is also fair to say that trying to construct that unity
 has often meant acting too little and too late, right?
 And of course, this is part of the reason,
 or large part of the reason why the war in Ukraine
 is not going as well as it probably could have done.
 However, if you stick to the question of unity,
 you could basically say, "Well, hey, you know,
 it may be that the EU has been slow and has done too little and too late,
 but hasn't the United States as well."
 So unity, obviously, there is not necessarily a problem,
 although obviously it is a problem if you look at your tears
 through the lens of Congress, but it is not something that is specific
 to the European Union given its very nature.
 So actually, I think Ukraine really points in the direction of saying,
 "Yes, indeed, diversity or divisions are a problem,
 but actually they haven't been the main problem in this particular case in point."
 Then you flip over onto the Middle East.
 And when you come to the Middle East, you basically sort of have a dramatically different picture.
 It is very clear that not only Europe is divided,
 that its divisions are playing out as time goes on,
 are playing out in multiple areas.
 So we were initially only, quote, divided as to whether we should be calling
 for a permanence use fire or not.
 Then we became also divided as to whether we should defund the UN Refugee Agency unwrapped.
 Then we became divided on whether we, this was an appropriate moment
 to recognize the state of Palestine.
 Then on top of that, we became also divided on what our approach should be
 to the international tribunals, namely the International Court of Justice
 and the International Criminal Court.
 And then very finely, we have also become divided as to whether we should use the leverage
 that the EU has vis a vis Israel through the Association Agreement
 to eventually suspend benefits recorded to Israel under that agreement.
 So on the Middle East, we are literally divided on each and every matter that emerges
 as the weeks and months of this war goes on.
 And I think it's also fair to say that if you look at Europe's approach to the Middle East,
 it has been an unmitigated disaster.
 You know, you probably will not find anyone, you know, where as I said,
 in the case of Ukraine, you can say, well, I mean, you know, we haven't been all that bad after all.
 So if you're not necessarily worse than others, but when it comes to Middle East,
 probably, you know, whether you ask anyone inside Europe or whether you, uncertainty,
 if you ask anyone outside Europe, is fairly clear that it has been a disaster all-round.
 However, and this is the point that I would like to end on, has that disaster in the Middle East
 actually been a product of division?
 I would argue not.
 I would argue that the reason why the EU's role has been such an unmitigated disaster has been
 because of the approach that we have taken on many of these questions.
 And so, you know, I said, I realized I was spoken too much, so I'll just stop here and perhaps
 you can take it up later.
 I would argue that when it comes to European forum policy in Europe's role in the world,
 often it is the unity that is a problem.
 When we are united, in, for instance, are lack of courage.
 When we are united in our lack of initiative, when we are united in our lack of leadership,
 when we are united in our lack of capacities, when we are united in our lack of endurance,
 that is very often, and I think it's true both in Ukraine and in the Middle East and in fact,
 around a far deeper problem than the rather post-emphasis explanation about the problem in European forum policy,
 which is divisions between member states.
 Thank you.
 Thank you so much, Jen Adely.
 I will get back to you on your very concrete vision on the European Union, you know, like how can we actually create unity,
 how can we overcome the lack of leadership in all these different divisions.
 But let's move on to two.
 I mentioned that you were a member of the Franco-German expert group on EU reform,
 and you also met Macron when he was here in Berlin just a couple of days ago.
 And I think, you know, all of us are very curious what's going on in the Franco-German couple,
 what's the joint vision that has been developed because I think, you know, on both sides,
 the German and the French side, there is a realization it cannot go on as it has been going on for the last years and months and even decades.
 So what's actually on the table? What are you discussing?
 Thank you.
 Thank you very much, Josefah, for the invitation.
 I'm very happy to be here.
 And indeed, the Dr. Law Center was at the State visit or part of the State visit of President Macron.
 In Berlin, we were at the democracy festival where we had the chance to meet both presidents and briefly exchange on our work on the EU together with a few students.
 I think when it comes to Franco-German cooperation, at the moment we are all reading, hearing, seeing the news on how the motor is stuttering
 and struggling a bit.
 I think there is merits to it, but what I want to say first on the Franco-German cooperation is that we also sort of need to take a step back and also see that as much as it might be struggling at times,
 it is still the cooperation that is the most hard-wired in the EU.
 So these are two member states whose cooperation is so far reaching on also so enshrined, in fact, that it is still more than we see between any other two member states in the EU.
 So I think the foundations of the Franco-German cooperation is strong and is there.
 That doesn't mean that it is always working as well as we would like it to. And I think currently we're seeing several reasons as to why there might be some stuttering or a few issues.
 And one is domestic reasons. So of course we have two countries, two leaders that are in somewhat difficult times in their own countries. And they're also very inward looking.
 Germany we have a coalition that is not working as well as we would like it to be perhaps even more striking than the Franco-German engine, which means of course a lot of attention is simply on the domestic politics.
 We see very similar things in France, where of course now with the European elections coming up, Macron's party is also not doing as well as perhaps it is being hoped for. So I think a lot also has to do with the fact that there's simply very little political capital at the moment to spend on Europe and to spend on France and Germany respectively, even though we see that Macron is trying a bit more to have this vision or come up with a vision for the future.
 Europe, then we see from the German leaders. Then of course it's difficult topics at the moment. It's energy, it's fiscal questions, it's enlargement, it's also it's also of course the time where the topics that are on the table that are being discussed are very uncomfortable and where positions simply differ.
 And this is not necessarily bad thing because of course the way Franco-German corporations are supposed to work, the way the engine is supposed to work is that France and Germany have different positions and if they come up with a compromise, if they can find a common position, then maybe this is actually a position that can take more member states on board, a compromise that can be carried also in other countries and member states.
 But it is of course the case that is currently simply a bit difficult in terms of topics and then lastly it also seems to be a personality issue.
 So, in my normal call and all of shorts are very different in the personalities and I think this is also something that of course plays into the whole Franco-German relationship.
 It is very structured, it is the countries, it is very deeply founded but it also has to do with interpersonal relationships and perhaps what we're seeing at the moment is that it does not match quite as well as it has.
 In the past nonetheless I don't think that in any way we should cancer the Franco-German engine or sort of have this narrative that it does not work at all because it is still there, it also works on a working level, there is cooperation and I think it is also important for the future of the opinion.
 So if we talk about unity or the future of the future European integration what we have always seen is that we are no longer in a time where Franco-German consensus is sufficient to move forward but we still need it if we want to move forward.
 Of course in cooperation with other member states and we're now we're seeing also the revival of the Vi-Maw triangle with Poland again as a priority but nonetheless if we want to move forward, if we want to have deeper integration.
 And a future also after European elections I think the Franco-German engine is still very much a necessity and very much also still present.
 Benedetta you work in the midst of NATO and NATO once again has turned into the cornerstone of European defence and still there's a lot of talk about a new division of labour.
 So if you could choose how would this new division of labour between the United States and European member states look like?
 Right, can I will get to that but maybe I will reframe it by starting taking maybe a step back because I think in order to think and through this practical question of how you divide labour you have to maybe start at a geopolitical level and say what are you confronted with?
 And what do you have to deal with and what are the responsibility and rules that follow from that?
 And I think that's very important because when you talk about competing visions for the European Union inevitably as a NATO official I'm not going to talk about what the EU's vision should be of course but I can say that I think there is a very easy
 job to get stuck into an internal inner looking discussion that at the end of the day talks about process talk about bureaucracy talks about tactical issues and in doing so misses the real geopolitical matter.
 And I think that will get that I'm not dodging your bullet I'm getting there but I think the real geopolitical matter today is that different EU member states may may have slightly distinct vision of where they want the European Union as a whole to go but I can tell you who has a very clear
 vision for the future of the EU and that's putting putting as very clear vision of how you want to see Europe wants to see Europe divided weak in able to act.
 It wants to see it centrally missed in Europe as a sphere of its influence to reclaim in this revival revival is new imperialist design so that's a competitive vision of Europe and we sometimes start by looking at what do we think amongst ourselves and we forget we are in the most complex and geopolitically fraught security
 environment in generations and there are competing visions that are exogenous to us one is Putin's vision and he's implementing that vision few kilometers from here in Ukraine which to me is where the future of Europe will be determined.
 And China is also very clear vision in my opinion the peoples Republic of China is a clear vision of where Europe should stand in the context of rising strategic competition again economically dependent vulnerable swing state in what is a larger geopolitical chess board so I think for us before we go into naval gazing which is a lot of our reflection as Europeans we should take into consideration what we're up against.
 And I think today we're up against a three part tight systemic challenge to essentially what has underpinned and allowed European Union to flourish one is the rules based international order which is under direct attack there is an authoritarian pushback I would say it's led by China and Russia and it's about promoting an alternative authoritarian model of global governance that will undermine each of every internal vision we have of the EU.
 That's at the global level internally they're taking that fight to our democracies through disinformation disinformation cyber attacks sabotage trying to leverage our economic dependencies to create vulnerability and that's about home struggle that goes for much more resilience and all of that is also occurring in a in a context in which you see growing authoritarian learning and cooperation and strategic adversarian alignment and again goes down to Ukraine.
 Look what's happening in Ukraine Russia is using Iranian drones it's using North Korean ammunition its war machine is systematically and fundamentally enabled by China's support and all of this has made disk actors essentially players in European security.
 So what I would say before we talk and have that beauty context sometimes we do NATO the EU at the Europe the United States let's I think take two step back and say what are we faced with and the only answer to growing authoritarian convergence and alignment as you see in Ukraine has to be more transatlantic at trans specific solidarity has to be for Europe to continue to build the European pillar with the NATO to strengthen the relations with the EU.
 We don't like the democracy day in the United States Australia Japan Korea New Zealand that's that's to me that's the geopolitical answer rather than looking in words because what is happening and I go I close here because I know I want to I want to keep to the five minutes that I just wanted to stress that a lot of what we're thinking and policies and designs a strategies will will eventually work or not work based on what happens in Ukraine.
 Are you trying to prevail? So the server independent democratic country that's that's a that's a that's a contingency we can talk about.
 Increase prosperity rebuilding this European security architecture that has essentially been being being eroded from within because of Russia's behavior over the last decades and that's that's a space in which can have competing democratic visions of the EU.
 Conversely a situation in which Ukraine does not prevail as a sovereign dependent country in which Putin's war of aggression is rewarded I think a lot of this conversation will be meaningless because will be in a completely different situation one in which our authoritarian adversaries are competitors from Beijing to Moscow to Tehran will have a field day.
 So in my so a lot of this is essential but a lot of this doesn't happen a lot of the discussion about European reform you reform for German relations all very very essential but none of that is going to matter unless we win this war.
 And not of it is going to matter until we keep our solidarity and recognize in that despite all our differences and I'm sure someone will ask about Trump so I'll tell let's talk about it when someone asked but let's keep the bigger picture in mind which is that there are.
 There are countries that have a real competitive vision for Europe and those are Russia and China and they are implementing it as we speak.
 I will also get back to you on your concrete vision because I also want you know like that you're absolutely right I think all of you are of course right but I think we also should get a little bit more concrete and depict a goal and end state of where we actually want to go on the European Union.
 But what comes after even if this is achieved but Charlie you can present better than none a US perspective I think a lot of us today feel happy and optimistic Trump maybe goes behind bars but you know of course on the other side of the Atlantic some folks might interpret this conviction in a very different way.
 So please enlighten us on what do you know like the different societal actors fields parties in the United States think about the EU and how can transatlantic relations you know be kind of put on a foundation that is durable and not flimsy as it seems right now.
 Thank you thank you Marina for inviting me it's an honor to share the stage in the virtual stage thank you to the team at the herty school Frank Gavin and others at Hopkins for pulling together what's been a fantastic few days here at the school.
 The clear lesson from the news that we've seen about Donald Trump is that if you're going to make a hush money payment to someone you need to make sure your business records are accurate.
 Otherwise you'll get in trouble so it's still I think in my view basically a 50 50 election.
 I was doing some reading in preparation for this and I read a piece that Natalie wrote in foreign affairs in February with co authors talking compellingly about how Europe needs to prepare for the possibility of a Trump victory.
 And Steve Sabo is here at a piece following up on that saying yeah but you also got to prepare for the possibility of a Biden victory and both of those things are true.
 And so they're very different people and I'd like to talk for a minute about the directions and tone I think that that both of them might pursue.
 But I do think there's a point to be made that as Benadetta has pointed out there's features of the geopolitical environment there's also features of American society and American politics that cross parties and that affect Europe.
