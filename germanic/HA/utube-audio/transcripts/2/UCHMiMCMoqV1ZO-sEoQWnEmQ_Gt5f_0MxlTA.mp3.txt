 Mein Name ist Marina Henke.
 Ich bin ein Professor in der Herdiskul und bin geliebt
 zu heute's Event,
 die Value der Grundstattung für Deutschland.
 Das Event ist fundiert
 bei der Europäischen Erkidemie Exchange-Thurvis
 oder der D.A.D.
 und ist eine Korpsproduktion
 des Kissenger-Center-Size-Johntopkins-Universität in Washington, DC
 und der Herdiskentreffent der National Security.
 Und das Event wird berekordet.
 So, was ist das?
 Aber nur der Teil,
 der Speakers eigentlich an der Zeit ist,
 die Kronat zu kommen,
 aber dann wird die YouTube-Pot aufgenommen
 und sich auf der D.A.D.
 und auch auf der Herdiskentreffent der National Security
 und auch auf der Kissenger-Center-Size-Johntopkins-Universität.
 In June 2023,
 die Kronatisierung des ersten,
 die National Security-Strategy
 in Deutschland,
 und die Dokumenten zu kratify,
 die Deutschland-Sighten-Wende,
 including die Security-Policy- und Doktorinnen-Changers,
 die Deutschland-Wennung in den Weg in die Wäckung des Präsenthars
 des Ukraine-Frushers.
 Und let's tell you,
 die Deutschland-Lerne des Präsenthars
 des Präsenthars,
 die Strategy ist wirklich hart.
 Die Strategy hat ein Fence,
 aber auch ein paar Kritik.
 Und jetzt,
 das questionen natürlich,
 die offen-Raced,
 was ist die Wäckung in den Enten der Grandstrategie
 oder eine Grandstrategie für die Deutschland-Wennung?
 Sie können das Exorcist bewerben.
 Sie sind all sorts von Neues und Sound,
 die Inkommung der New-Government,
 die auch eine neue National Security-Strategy,
 aber dann die Frage,
 ob sie von der Strasse starten,
 oder ob sie mit den Spitz- und Pieces
 der Dokumenten, die in 2023 gesetzt wurden.
 Und zwei von unserer Panelisten,
 Thomas Doflan-Hogayano,
 Schpost-Professors,
 Edt der Deutschland-Fetal-Universität
 auf applied administrative Sciences,
 hier in Berlin,
 haben wirkt,
 an der meisten Störerstehten
 der Deutschland-First National Security-Strategy,
 analysing, among others,
 was key Ideas
 in Deutschland-Strategy-Develop-In-Process,
 how the process was structured,
 and also what first lessons
 can be drawn from the strategies,
 writing, and implementation,
 and processes.
 To other of our panelists,
 Kastina Schpoer
 und Frank Gavin,
 are world-renowned experts
 on German grand strategic thinking.
 Kastina is a Professor
 of International History
 at the London School of Economics,
 and author, among others,
 of post-wall, post-square,
 or in German,
 vendet site,
 which was named
 to the best political science book
 in Germany in 2020,
 in which analyzes
 first Germany's completion
 of the first grand strategical,
 if you want, German Reunification,
 but also describes
 this kind of vacuum
 that this gap in grand strategic thinking
 that open up in Germany
 in the early 1990s,
 once German Reunification
 had actually occurred.
 And the second book,
 which I also greatly admire,
 is called
 the Global Chancellor,
 a book on the German Chancellor Helmut Schmitt,
 which I think was actually
 the best grand strategic thinker
 in post-war Germany,
 but arguably that's debatable,
 but certainly he was one
 of the great strategic thinkers
 Germany has produced ever since 19th,
 in 1945.
 And then we have Frank Gavin,
 the Giovanni Aniele,
 distinguished professor
 and director of the Henry Kissinger Center
 at Seiss Schonz Hopkins.
 Among his many, many achievements
 are his two groundbreaking books,
 which also deal
 with German grand strategy.
 Although it's not mentioned directly
 in the title of the book,
 but in the first book,
 he wrote,
 "Gold dollars in power,
 the politics of international monetary relations,
 1958 to 1971,
 Germany plays a major role,
 in the ways of how Germany yields its financial power
 and its economic power
 after the Wutchappswunder.
 And in his other book,
 "Nuclear Statecraft,
 History and Strategy in America's Atomic Age,"
 Germany plays a very important role,
 and especially its nuclear ambitions
 and how America dealt with it.
 Both of them
 will analyze
 and help us understand
 how German strategic thinking
 and strategy development
 has evolved ever since 1945,
 how successful it was
 and how it contrasts
 to the strategy that was developed more recently
 and that Thomas
 and Holger will explain to us.
 So the event today
 will start with Thomas
 and then Holger
 and then we will move over
 to Christina and then Frank.
 And then I have a couple questions for you
 and then we will open up for Q&A very quickly.
 So let's give our famed panelists
 a very warm welcome.
 (applause)
 It's on, okay, great.
 Good, I could have.
 (inaudible)
 Or the invitation
 for organizing the last two days
 that have been fascinating
 and for organizing this public event.
 It's great to be here, so thanks a lot
 for putting this off.
 I'd like to start the conversation
 by again repeating that Holger and I,
 we did the first comprehensive academic review
 of the German national security strategy.
 It's going to be published next month.
 It's going to be open access
 in the German set shift for politik
 as a special issue.
 It brings together 16 written contributions
 by 19 authors who dealt with various,
 sort of from various perspectives
 with the written product
 of the national security strategy
 looking from the perspective of political science,
 public administration,
 but also we have legal scholars involved
 looking at the functions of the strategy,
 the policy areas, robustness, resilience,
 sustainability,
 and the institutionalization of the strategy.
 We hope that this volume will be a start
 of the academic and public debate
 on the future of the German national security strategy.
 To start with, I think,
 the intention of the authors of the strategy
 was to actually write a strategy.
 To write a strategy in the end's ways
 means logic of how to write a security strategy.
 This is also reflected in the structure
 of the document defining goals,
 assessing threats,
 and detailing a long list of means.
 Having said that,
 I want to share some key results
 of our volume.
 While there are some good things
 that can be said about the strategy,
 for instance, one of the most important lines,
 the one in Russia,
 that is sort of the time to come,
 the biggest threat to your Atlantic security.
 Of course, we were focusing a lot
 on the shortcomings of the strategy,
 and I'd like to highlight three particular shortcomings
 regarding the ends, the means,
 and the overall strategic logic.
 Looking at the ends,
 what we find,
 several of our chapters find,
 that there's a missing prioritization
 and a certain ambivalence regarding the goal.
 There's a long list of goals
 that are in the strategy,
 that some of them are kind of weak,
 such as fostering peace and security,
 or securing access to water,
 and people's health.
 That makes, of course,
 implementation difficult,
 and prioritization is missing here.
 The strategy also doesn't really address,
 sort of, the trade-offs between different goals,
 or which of the goals are the priorities,
 and what does that mean then,
 for the other goals?
 We also find that there is an insufficient threat assessment
 that's a chapter on that,
 that I authored in the Waldum,
 while the strategy identifies a number of threats,
 I think, what is missing
 is a deeper understanding
 of where these threats are coming from,
 what the interactions are between the threats
 that are identified,
 and how those threats are then connected
 with the means to address.
 For instance, we have Iran and North Korea identified
 as a threat,
 but then we don't find any means
 that address those threats in the strategy,
 which brings me to the ways and means,
 and these are actually the longer,
 the most detailed parts of the strategy,
 and we find really long lists
 of already existing programs
 that have been sort of listed in the strategy,
 and for instance, there's a very detailed part on defense,
 where the strategy lists a lot of things
 that already are happening,
 and one of the chapters is dealing
 with the question of why there is actually so little innovation
 in this particular part of the strategy.
 And what we also find other chapters is that,
 on top of the long list of means,
 we find very little on how those means are going to be used,
 and what kind of combination are they integrated,
 are they sequentially used,
 and all these sorts of things.
 Which brings me to my third point,
 the overall strategic logic,
 and what we try to do with our sort of research focus
 on the strategies to think what can research actually bring,
 get us when we formulate security strategies,
 and what we find looking at particularly definitions
 of key terms that are used in the strategies
 that they are either often used to narrowly or to broadly,
 to make a couple of examples,
 the term resilience is very important in the strategy,
 but it's just used in a way that we want to be ready to absorb
 a certain shock in terms of supply chains, for instance.
 But what is missing is thinking about how we could actually adapt
 or transform our societies to become more resilient,
 so not just look at the shock absorption,
 but also the adaptation.
 Deterrence is another key term that is used,
 and that is only used again very narrowly
 in the sense of military deterrence,
 but the strategy spans very few lines on economic deterrence,
 so how economic state craft could be used
 as a form of deterring our threats that are identified.
 Or another example would be democracy,
 where again we find a very broad definition of democracy,
 one of the chapters that deals with the concept of militancy,
 the concept of militant democracy as it's used in the strategy,
 and the author, Henry K. Gemann, finds that with the securitization view
 that the referent object is very broadly defined,
 so not just democracy in the sense of the functioning of democratic institutions,
 but also more general cultural norms of German society,
 the stability of German society.
 Again, the threat is also very broadly defined in terms of classical forms
 of radicalization extremism, new forms of extremism,
 external actors that are also threatening democracy,
 and again the means to address those are also very broad
 from political education to classical forms of policing.
 And that's where the merit of our work comes in
 is that we can use political science concepts
 to make sense of how they are used in the strategy
 and think about how they should be used in a better way.
 So thank you, thank you very much for having me, Marina.
 It's really a pleasure to be here.
 I think Thomas already said everything.
 I know about this security strategy,
 so let me maybe start with an obvious but still important point.
 Having a grand strategy does not guarantee better results.
 So it's simple, but it's important.
 It's not a cure for all the security illnesses of Germany or Europe.
 So often we think, okay, grand strategy is just a list of end-waste means,
 but usually it's more, it's an intellectual framework,
 a state theory to quote Barry Posner or Horbrandt's two famous
 grand strategy scholars.
 So if this is a grand strategy, if a theory,
 it can be based on wrong assumptions, incorrect hypothesis,
 or misleading empirical evidence,
 and then it can be ineffective or even counterproductive.
 So we have to always be aware,
 they are not only risks without strategy,
 but also risk from strategy.
 So now let's have a look on Germany and the future of German security.
 So Germany is right now in a process I would call of strategic reconstruction.
 So the new coalition agreed to create a national security council,
 which will be responsible for the next German security strategy.
 So this new government has now an unique opportunity to create something,
 something really which set the path for an effective security strategy development
 that can contribute fundamentally to the German and European security.
 However, this opportunity comes also with the downside that any institutional shortcomings
 might lead to lasting negative effects for German security.
 So my goal in the next four or five minutes is not to assess the pros or cons
 of the National Security Council, but to point out a aspect that should be considered
 when designing the National Security Council with regard to strategy development.
 So from my perspective, it's really important to consider that a National Security
 strategy has several important central functions.
 So depending on which functions take center stage for the next government,
 the personnel institutional budgetary requirements for the National Security Council
 may differ or change depending on the circumstances.
 In the introduction of our special issue, we kind of introduced or summarized
 seven central functions of a National Security strategy,
 and I want to now group them into three arguments.
 So my first argument is that when thinking about a National Security Strategy,
 most scholars or practitioners think about a written strategic document
 that defines the ways and means that will be used to achieve specific ends.
 So if the central function of a security strategy is to provide such a strategic guide or concept,
 research on form policy making or in specific other National Security Councils
 can provide us some insights, and I think they kind of point out to three common problems
 in decision making in National Security Councils.
 One is individual biases or beliefs, group think and unintended past dependencies.
 So the new government should consider the insights of this research to avoid these kind of problems.
 However, from my perspective, which is really more important is to create some institutional element
 that facilitate innovation.
 So the great question is how can Germany come up with what British scholars call a big idea?
 Okay, let's take a look on businesses.
 Such as businesses have to reinvent themselves to survive in a free market.
 States have to sink ahead of rivals in the international system.
 So I think, or I hope, that research can provide some insights to help the new government
 to come up with institutional solutions.
 So my second argument is that the process of developing a security strategy is not only focused on creating
 such a written document or a strategic guide.
 The process itself has a purpose.
 So the process itself kind of can help to shape a common strategic culture between different departments and agency.
 And it also can improve inter-agency cooperation or coordination in practice.
 So when designing the new national security council, I think or hope that the new government embraces and facilitates these function of a national security strategy.
 And I think here research, different research fields like organization theory, historical institutionalism or new institutionalism approaches on bureaucratic politics can help and give some advice how to design a new security council.
 Which brings me to my last argument.
 Third, to guarantee that a strategy really helps to achieve specific ends. I think the new national security council needs authority to monitor the implementation of the strategy.
 So this is really important not only to create accountability or to put pressure on decision makers and bureaucracy, but also for adaptation.
 So we now live in a world where the international environment is constantly changing.
 So we need to adapt to constantly to these new environment or new strategic situations.
 And the national security council needs institutions that are flexible enough to adapt to these kind of situations.
 And again, I make like advertisement for science, but here different fields like public management, research on government and accountability, but also research on public opinion can help to come up with good solutions.
 So to kind of summarize my argument, strategy development shouldn't be not just understand as producing a written document or strategic guide, but comprises various functions, doing the development process itself and its implementation.
 So all these functions should be considered when designing the national security council in particular because all the different functions for my perspective reinforce each other.
 So it makes sense to consider all these functions.
 So social scientists can provide new ideas, concepts, empirical evidence and methods and help the German government to come and find new solutions.
 However, I want to conclude with a word of self criticism.
 I think that German political science and international relations have neglected strategic questions and issues for most part.
 Strategic studies in the German political science community are only a small part. Marina is one of it.
 And thank you very much for this kind of event. So I would argue and I think the other panelists agree. I hope so.
 That the German political science had different turns in the past, the normative turn, a constructive turn. I think we need now a strategic turn.
 Thank you very much.
 Well, thank you so much Thomas and Hologör indeed kind of preaching to the choir here. But I once more want to congratulate you on this incredibly important work.
 I was very worried that when the national security strategy first got published, that everybody would just like for a minute, pay some attention and then put it in a drawer and then it was the end of it.
 But you really picked up this document and also approached me and others and said, let's use this right. This is a flawed document, but still it is the start of a new era.
 And you know, like I like this, you know, like this maybe strategic turn of German political science, but at least like a subfield of German political science.
 Let's use this that discuss it. Let's open a public debate about it. Let's analyze it and let's think through how we can do this better. And I think we have a real chance now with the new incoming government and the idea of the National Security Council and the updating of this process to have a lot of your ideas influence the new document.
 And so I think this is really a super important effort. So thank you very much. Now we will turn to the past because you know, like a lot of folks say Germany never had a grand strategy and you know, like it never was able to think strategically.
 I think Christina and Frank can tell us otherwise. So Christina, take the floor.
 Yeah, so. And so back in time, we're going back through now the 80s and 70s and even further. Let me introduce you to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Also sort of under the premise of some things we have discussed here as part of the conference for the last couple of days, namely that on the one hand, we have now looked at this first German document of this national security strategy.
 But of course, if you think of the Cold War period and even what happened beyond, we didn't have this kind of document. So how were these kind of grand policies, ideas, strategies being put forward.
 And I'm sort of looking also at this question in that case of leadership. So in the absence of a document, what can we say about leadership transformative leadership, a leader with strategic thought, a leader, Chancellor, who in the German context uses his right-linear competence, really sort of driving the foreign security and defense policies.
 And perhaps even larger, not forgetting, of course, that in Germany, the chanceless always work within a coalition. And at the two chanceless, I'm looking at, although I'm perhaps focusing in my formal part more on Schmidt and then in the Q&A, I can say, more on cool.
 Both had Genshin as a foreign minister and therefore quite a sort of strong counterpart, perhaps with slightly different perspectives. But what I also want to highlight is that the chanceless I'm looking at, they functioned in the case of divided Germany in a semi-Sovarant, there's Germany, a country without nuclear weapons, a country whose policies up to a point where, of course, curtailed precisely because of that.
 Status, namely in particular, that anything related to the German question, had to be dealt with the victim powers. So that's sort of always hovering the background. So what can a chance ladoo in a situation in a legal situation and political situation in that bipolarity? What are his freedoms?
 And what are his freedoms in terms of shaping policy when we think that strategic thinking or a strategy has a lot to do with how to make that country secure?
 So what can we say? I mean, Schmidt, interesting, 1974, comes into power at a time of deep crisis, global crisis, collapse of the Brettonwood system, deep economic crisis in all the open societies and the global economy.
 And there's always this question when you pursue strategy, do you pursue a particular strategy out of, in response to a shock? Or do you pursue a strategy also on your own volition? Because you may have some thoughts.
 And that's where Schmidt is interesting, because first of all, he becomes chancellor in the aftermath of the Geomefare. And so in that sense unexpectedly, so already that's, you have to respond to that situation by being put into this position.
 And then because the global international system is at such a crisis point, especially from a Western perspective.
 And Schmidt said something very interesting when it now comes to speeches. And I'm using speeches to show you what we discussed also in this conference as a sort of declaratory policy.
 So when in the absence of a strategy paper, how do you communicate to your electorate? How do you communicate at home? And to the world your views? And I'm not talking about vision, you know, Schmidt hated that word, but we talked about some sort of strategic aspects.
 So first I want to focus on Schmidt as an intellectual, somebody with intellectual hinterland in particular the economy. That is also the crisis he comes into in this in this Cold War context. And he said that economic stability could not be separated from military security, because those together are the foundations of peace.
 And he came to this as a trained economist and as somebody who had held the positions of finance minister and defense minister under the brand government. So he came also this political experience to this job.
 He said that as a chancellor, he wanted to concentrate what is essential and to achieve what is possible. So it's a bit about the art of the possible.
 And he did this against sort of his own notion of, you know, how do we want to operate what kind of world do we want to operate in? He believed in cooperation and interdependence in this sort of wider global context.
 And he worried that world economic stagnation and a inward looking drive also in the Western society is not just when you looked at Soviet Union and China, turned towards more our our target behavior, turned to protectionist trade.
 And thereby also you know deepening the recession that that would make everything worse because there was a fear for in his mind that if we go down that route, then that's bad for the democratic structures.
 And that is bad for the democratic structures in particular for in these industrial societies and that democracy actually would break up and of course in a Cold War context that also would be sort of the end of the Western world if you so want in a grand scale.
 So he said the grave economic situation, which is of course tied up also with the oil crisis in other words energy security again something at rings a bell today is really posing a grave danger and we need to do something about it.
 We need to stabilize the situation and we need to do so for world peace.
 So economics always connected with security and he wanted to do this in political unity in Europe but in partnership with the United States. So that's where you also have that Euro Atlantic Alliance not just through NATO per se but also in this sort of wider picture.
 And what did he say about his view of foreign policy in this and that's where I want to quote he said foreign policy today is not just a specialist discipline for well dressed white bearded well behaved diplomats.
 Now foreign policy is also world economic policy world material policy world agricultural policy world monetary policy and world security policy right because we live in a universal system of mutual dependence whether we want it or not we cannot get away with it in other words if we think about foreign and security policy we have to think about the whole range and in some ways.
 However difficult it is to grasp that that sort of cancel a mid-veil if you so want and white brick is in some ways also of course reflected in the strategy that we are talking about.
