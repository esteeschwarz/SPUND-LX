We introduce the linguistic phenomena of deictic anchoring and propositional complexity, explain how they relate to schizophrenic symptoms, and demonstrate how they can be tracked in language behavior.},

            Universal dependencies (UD) is a framework for morphosyntactic annotation of human language, which to date has been used to create treebanks for more than 100 languages. In this article, we outline the linguistic theory of the UD framework, which draws on a long tradition of typologically oriented grammatical theories. Grammatical relations between words are centrally used to explain how predicate–argument structures are encoded morphosyntactically in different languages while morphological features and part-of-speech classes give the properties of words. We argue that this theory is a good basis for crosslinguistically consistent annotation of typologically diverse languages in a way that supports computational natural language understanding as well as broader linguistic studies.},

{\textless}p{\textgreater}The texts were annotated using the ARRAU guidelines which treat all noun phrases (NPs) as markables. Different semantic roles are recognized by distinguishing between referring expressions (that update or refer to a discourse model), and non-referring ones (including expletives, predicative expressions, quantifiers, and coordination). A variety of linguistic features were also annotated, including morphosyntactic agreement, grammatical function, semantic type (person, animate, concrete, action, time, other abstract) and genericity. The annotation was carried out using the {\textless}a href="http://mmax2.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"{\textgreater}MMAX2 annotation tool{\textless}/a{\textgreater} which allows text units to be marked at different levels.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}

	abstract = {We introduce a fully differentiable approximation to higher-order inference for coreference resolution. Our approach uses the antecedent distribution from a span-ranking architecture as an attention mechanism to iteratively refine span representations. This enables the model to softly consider multiple hops in the predicted clusters. To alleviate the computational cost of this iterative process, we introduce a coarse-to-fine approach that incorporates a less accurate but more efficient bilinear factor, enabling more aggressive pruning without hurting accuracy. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art span-ranking approach, our model significantly improves accuracy on the English OntoNotes benchmark, while being far more computationally efficient.},
