## conclusion
After evaluating over the different approaches we find our hypothesis proved, that anaphora distances in the target corpus (target=OBS) stretch over a significantly (p\<0.001) wider range of tokens between reference and referent in contrast to the chosen reference corpus. With our assumptions this could prove a less appropriate estimate for the coherence of the own texts produced in schizophrene language still having in mind, that a wider distance is not stating incoherence in general but instead just that these speakers allow for a wider anaphora distance in their text production. If these distances indeed lead to less coherent texts compared to the reference corpus must be subject to close reading and annotating samples manually and questioning them in terms of coherence by skilled readers though annotation may vary strongly depending on the disposition of readers and their general capacities of infering references. But if we agree that shorter reference distances increase text coherence then we might say the texts produced in the target corpus are less coherent than those in the reference corpus which alignes with the common classification of patients language in psychiatry.

## limitations
We had to do some silent assumptions, but the main limitation is that we will have to base our specification of the target corpus as being one that is containing schizophrene language mainly on the statements of the reddit users in our target corpus which do describe themselves as being diagnosed schizophrene to a large amount. To what extend these statements and assignments or identifications are true we cannot say and therefore limit the value of our findings only to that group of speakers.
