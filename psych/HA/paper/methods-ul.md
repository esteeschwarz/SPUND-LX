## methods
To compute distances we queried the corpus for matching conditions where certain (probable) determiners appear before analogue nouns (anaphors). For each datapoint we collect variables as:

- thread url
- author (anonymised)
- thread length (tokens)
- lexical diversity (type/token ratio)
- lemma
- distance (to the preceding occurence, e.g. for three occurences of [dog]() we collect 2 distance datapoints)

The main function to determine the distances runs on a subset of the corpus with only including all nouns and their position in the corpus. It finds all duplicated nouns per url thread and computes their distances by token position.

## reflections
### range
Evaluating with a growing corpus and (reaching up to M[odel]()12 with our methods of computing distances) we interestingly find our basic hypothesis tested again, showing an overall larger distance of analogue nouns within the range of 1 thread url for the target corpus. While until M7 we devised distances from a manually assigned url identifier we saw the necessity to define our "range of interest" according to the original http url of the thread, since with a growing corpus the old url ids - derived from the get_thread_url() method of the redditExtractoR package (@rivera_redditextractor_2023) used for fetching the reddit content - there a no new url ids created since one url fetch gets each time always only around 1000 urls. To ensure unique url ranges within the corpus we as said in M11 assigned the range (within which the noun distance is calculated) to the real thread url. The corpus itself is after each fetch sorted after url and timestamp so it represents the real flow of conversation within one thread which is important since our distance model is based on the token distances within that thread, so they should follow their natural occurence in time.

### author trace id
Another nice new feature in M11 is the aut_id variable which represents the comment author and is unique to that. In the base .sqlite database the authors are already anonymised, so there should be no way from the published data back to the original author name of the comment. But, as also expected, including aut_id as random effect in the linear regression model, the significance level for the covariables of interest as are

1. q = the condition matching of the noun-preceding token
2. det = wether that match has postag "DET"
3. target = obs or reference corpus
finally increases.

### lexical diversity
We thought about some serious caveats within the latest  method: If (lucky for our hypothesis) the target corpus has significantly higher distance scores over nearly all conditions, does that automatically indicate a less coherent reference-referent association within what is expressed in the comments? Couldn't we also assume that if the analogue nouns appear more distanced in general that a topic which is including these nouns is simply expanding over a wider range i.e. timeframe? What does that do to our assumptions in terms of coherence? A good way here could be to integrate (from M3) a general lexical diversity factor per url as fixed effect because we can assume that a higher type/token ratio logically decreases the probability of a noun appearing multiple times within a range and we could take that effect into account. 

### semantics, word field, embeddings
Further we created another covariable possible to integrate in the evaluation model: The semantic embedding of one specific noun appearing on its specific position in the thread range, computed with help of an open LL word embedding model (@nussbaum_nomic_2024.) This is a common AI way of devising semantic relations in a corpus which exceeds a just frequency based keyword analysis. Using an LLM here allows for a distinctive identification of world field embeddings of the noun in question. In that way we get another variable linguistic feature extracted which may give general insights into the level of standardisation that applies to the corpora. So if a noun is found to be embedded with a high score into its context (the url thread) then it can be very much expected to be found there and appears less out-of-context.[^1]

### statistics
In this context we thought about what it means statistically, if a high-score embedded word also ranks high in (distance) significance i.e. generally what the relations of the covariates in the context of the linear regression evaluation express. Let us picture this:

1. a word receives a high embed score if it is highly semantically related to the context within which it appears, here the comment thread.
2.  therefore the necessity to introduce/elaborate on it sinks, since it may be considered a "known" or "inferable" entity within the context given.
3. now if a person is using this word, the determined use appears less incoherent by itself.
4. the reference distance thus may increase without losing in coherence.
5. **conclusion:** if we for our linear regression use a (base) formula like `distance ~ corpusÂ ` , a continuos `embed_score` predictor between `-1 and 1` should correlate positive with the estimates for `dist` if applied correctly, nestcepas?

### caveats
Since devising the word embed score does take much computing ressources we had a script run on a server that solves the computing. But the first essai to integrate the new var into the evaluation model failed due to levels \< 2. Why? Because since we ran the script over the complete url ranges in the corpus and that is sorted after target,[^2] we did not compute any values for the reference corpus. So we learned this way again on linear regression models which require that a variable has more than one level (which would not be the case if the lmer() function excludes all NA rows: there would be no observations left with target=ref since all its embed.score values are NA and so all target.ref rows will be removed during regression.)
