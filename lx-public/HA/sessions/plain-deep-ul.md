### deep
digging deeper into the blog, we find that the site is built upon wordpress and also hosted via wordpress. that hints to some basics to mention.

#### height
hosting a site via wordpress.com is not a cheap business, cf. @wordpress_wordpress_2023; the technical affordances are moderate to low i.e. with minimal tech knowledge you can build a nice looking and good working web presence. since the site itself doesnt offer own posts which are not announcements or links to articles on magazines or newspapers, we conclude that its not really active posting here or :content creating: in the sense of a blog. it's more a landing page for content published elsewhere which means we won't find content that has not undergone external review process. so no amateur business at all. 

#### actual
concerning our validating the article links provided on the page we can say, that there's less effort spent on keeping the site uptodate. it's bit frustrating to land on 404 pages; at least the toast articles are archived at @mcculloch_linguist_2025.
