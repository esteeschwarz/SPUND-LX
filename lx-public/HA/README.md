- CMS backend based on github workflow
- why:
    - cms used until (wordpress) forces users to use wordpress UI or worst case deliver finalised content which authenticated users post to database > this prevents most users to continually work on or post content a actively
    - github offers several approaches to allow unlimited users to create content based on simple .csv tables or .md or plain texts which then are rendered to html frontend which is dependent on framework more or less customizable
- caveats:
    - public data storage
    - anyone with access can edit anything / admins have to keep track of organisation users
