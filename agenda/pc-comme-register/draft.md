#### ideas
we have an intuitive impression, that the use of p/c language is undergoing a recent manifestation as a new register of language. that is, people using p/c language are deciding just within the situation of a communication to using or not using p/c speech.    
as for similar phenomena concerning the use of vernacular or standard, dialect or high (language), mother- or countryspoken language (code switching), we think to correctly adress this with the term :translanguaging: where one decides between different modes (styles) of expressing while making use of different :registers:.   
we have to become clear about the term :register: and connect this to corpus based observations, preferedly spoken corpora of natural language.
