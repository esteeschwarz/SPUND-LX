2. okay, we'll let her know that you're not interested in her.  I'm sure she'll be devastated, but will continue to move on with her life.
3. okay but I feel like youre missing the subtext of that expression. Its implied to mean that you cant control how someone reacts &. without using manipulation tactics. No shit. Everyone knows that. You cant control what people think, say, react to, or feel, under regular circumstances in healthy relationships. If you manipulate someone in to one of those situations, you are an abuser, who isnt the intended audience of that message.
